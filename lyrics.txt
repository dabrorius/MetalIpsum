Out of my darkness it's rising in me
Discover s the feelings hidden so deep
I lose myself
Affection for sadness and longing for pain
I is dividing - deciphers the madness
I loose myself
Oh - The human bondage
No way to control it
I have to obey
Just can't deny it - so deep inside me
I lose myself
My personal demon is linking the shades
I could never see
Now I know who I am
I see myself
Oh - The human bondage
I hate you
I hate you
I hate you
I am you
Oh - The human bondage


With might the forceful makers build
Machines that will take control
Inhuman - They use us to
build and to guide them
We turn our backs and we'll lose it all


Don't say goodbye
You tried and you tried
You lied and you left me here for so long
Don't say farewell
When you go to hell
You're a machine and you will never die

Inhuman - They are taking over

And they will always be
Wind up men controlling us
Manifesto humanity


Starlight shines in another world 
Spent my life in a dark dismay
It starts with you for what it's worth
Can't speak your name, or I go insane

In another world - back to my soul
I know there's nothing here, oh yeah

Seems I'm back in a loveless world
Can't understand what it's worth
Step outside the lifeless game
I've never understood what it says

In the fucking world blacks out my soul
I know there's nothing real - oh

There's nobody else who gives this to me
'Cause whoever said my soul would heal?
There's no one who shares in my whole misery
For who will say my soul is real?

I step outside this fucking cage
New forms of life cry out and rage
I feel flying back the loveless fear
To check and see my soul is real






There's no one who shares in this whole mystery
'Cause whoever said my soul was real?
I laugh out but now of the whole misery
'Cause who will save my soul, it's real


I'm walking and watching
All the things I've seen before a million times
It's cold neon light
A stranger on his way
A world, that's always been cold and gray
Just wait another day

Tell me now - Is this the world that you have made for me?
Is this all you'll let me be?

Hold the children for me
That scream in the night because of you
It's empty - no light
You've told me that I am impersonation of humanity
I only want to cease to be

Tell me now - Is this the only world that you have made for me?
Is this all you'll let me be?

Hold me now
Save me from the ghosts that haunt my nights
Don't say goodbye
When the shadows fall down on me in the night
Alone - again

Just for your love I will be undead for all eternity
You're watching over me
Lovely creature - darkest night
Come back again to me
It's just like you...were once before




Don't tell me now that this is the only world - oh no
Don't tell me about your point of view
Save it for someone else - what to do
Alone again


It's a tragedy - that's coming near
Hatred chains our thoughts - born in fear
Makes our children be martyrs of vanity
Sacrifice in another gods name

We speak of love and mercy 
While only bullets answering every thrown stone
We praise our lord in heaven
But all our deeds are by blood and pain

Let's lay down our swords now
And let the blood dry now
It's not our destiny to be enemies
There can be a tomorrow
So let the blood dry now
No war can last forever

Time of killing lasts for so many years
Life lights burn so fast - all that's left are tears
Do you really believe our gods want us to kill?
Not one word of our belief tells this is out lords will

Time runs fast for you and me
But still our souls can be saved by the glory of love
Take the hand that reaches out for you
Let's end the madness before it's too late - too late






Don't speak...
Of the silence that falls on the future
I won't say - but I believe there is something in my mind 
It's hard to expect there will be no surprises
Don't feel - there's a sign of what's coming - we divide

Keep us together
Don't silence our souls
In this dread - ripped apart again

You know my aim is for you to be my last resort
Don't heed the empty mindless call
I don't feel hatred towards you
This is my last remorse
Here comes the ending
Unite - in the mystic world
Unite - in the mystic world
Unite - and overcome

Don't say that the cries of tomorrow are silenced
Don't think like we will be living in ecstasy





Don't feel my agony now
This is my last real hope
Don't heed the empty mindless call
I don't feel hatred towards you
This is my last remorse
Here comes the ending
Unite - in the mystic world
Unite - in the mystic world
Unite and overcome


Light a candle for redemption
Ridiculous you are
Blame the demons
Blame the fire for atrocity

Wise man's words of revelation
Stuck inside your minds
Destination Arian-nation
Hate is what you are

I am the pain you suffer
I am the hope you feel
I am eternal fire - for you believe
I've got this evil - got this evilness

Salem's burning, crosses turning
Burn in desire's name
Light a candle for redemption
Riculous you are




Come and rise from your grave again
Rise above them and fight again
I'm the one you're calling
And watch me - show them all
Without me you'll be obscene
I'll save you from it all

Release your confessions
Give your life to me
Let me open your sewn shut eyes
See only me
I'm the one you're calling
And watch me - show them all
Obey me until your life is lost

Come to me with sorrow
I'll let you live again
There is no tomorrow
I am your only friend
Your time has been so sick
You're living in sorrow and pain
There is no tomorrow - take my hand

What is it inside you eating you within?
I drown in life's waters
A sea of despair
Hear me now I'm calling
So you can see the way to me
I'll leave you blind and hopeless
You should have never listened to me

Come to me with sorrow
I'll let you live again
There is no tomorrow
I am your only friend
Your time has been so sick
You're living in sorrow and pain
There is no tomorrow - take my hand

I'm the one you're calling
And watch me - show them all
Without me you'll be obscene
I'll save you from it all
Release your confessions
Give your life to me
Let me open your sewn shut eyes
See only me again


Listen - did you hear that voice from inside ourselves
It's echoeing the weariness that's hunting us
It's getting dark we both can see
Pathetic words won't rescue me
Love is just another word for grief

We are drowning in the tears once fallen
Why don't the shadows disappear?

Please awake you holy one
Please awake 'cause freedom awaits
Now awake my only one
Please awake 'cause freedom awaits

It's useless to love the one I hurt so deep
Can you feel the slowing down of time?
One word could even make you cry
One single touch could make you die
You must know I never could resist





So you want to be free
To live your life the way you want to be
Will you give if we cry
Will we live or will we die, yeah

Solitary brother, is there still a part of you that wants to live
Solitary sister, is there still a part of you that wants to give

Jaded hearts heal with time
Shoot that love so we can stop the bleeding
If we try and live our lives
The way we want, the way we want to be, yeah




Racism in among future kings can lead to no good
Besides all our sons and daughters already know how that feels

ANGEL DUST LYRICS


Separate me from the dead all around
Smashed into the ground
Ecstasy of killing blinded my eyes
I cannot remember the day it has begun,
Nor do I know why
Once I learned to kill and fight
For a battle that was in sight
When I'm dreaming,
I still hear them marching on
In the darkness,
Innocence got ripped
Out of my heart
I washed my hands in the blood of
The man that just have been killed
The beast in me had risen again,
Gave death into my hands
Oh, ripping, shooting, burning
That's the way, that I got drilled
Menmachine of no remorse.
The killer is deep in me
When I'm dreaming
I still hear them marching on
In the darkness. I start to pray:
Let me live, let me love again
Let me drop my head - into your lap
Let me live - let me love again
Ease my pain - when I'm home again
Wondering 'bout what a man is able to take
Wondering why I'm still alive
Exodus of humanity, already, it hast begun
Skulls and bones around me
A bloodbath full of lies
Insignia of imperfection branded in every face


Slip into my outfit
Dress up like it shall be
I'm correct, I'm an ideal
There are thousands to be led
I see divine visions
We'll rise as high as the sky
I look into the mirror
Is this my face I see?
I'm deeply involved into
A brand new hast - and I hear him say:
Break the chains that tie you down
And be again the one you are
Lift the weakness off your heart
And be again the one you are
You?re like the rolling thunder
Your heart is made of steel
Undefeated on the field of honour
I believe, he is holy
Electrifying each and every soul

Oh my dear husband, open your frozen heart
I miss so much of you, where has all your love gone?

And she says:
Break the chains that tie your soul
And be against the one you are
Lift the shadows off your heart
And be again the one you are
Are you still the loving father
Your children can look up to?
Open your heart again for humanity


I can smell the sweat and blood around me
I can hear you screaming loud for me
Blow him into nothingness you're shouting
No one but me shall walk out of the pit
Meet my rival for the very first time
Gotta make sure, it will be his last
You don't like to pay for naught and nothing
All you wanna see is, I bring him pain
And I know, all your love is with me
-Beat him, -tread him, -kill him-
I'm your sword, I'm your angel of death
This is the place where you dreams become true
This is the place where I kill for you
This is your time of diversion and fun
So enjoy!!

I am heart and soul of all you people
Bearing all your hatred in my fists
I'm licensed to kill for your pleasure
In your name, I bring the deepest pain


For me and I
Live seems so hard at all
Not even worth a dime
Need to do some kind of crime
I'm looking up
To a high command
But watching you tears me in two
To sell myself I got to do
There's no return now
If I want to go my way
To leave this life of a dying man
I would sell my soul to anyone
Here I am, an eternal slave
I will do what you like
I will be at your side - I'm alright
I would die to be your friend
Fly away to the other side
Fly away to the point of entry
Fly away to what?s so high above
Will you establish me
In your company?
Oh please
I'll be forever yours
Seems I am none, but I'm sure I'll be one
There's a place for me too
Just tell me what to do


I lay awake every night, thinking about what to do
I already know we will surely come to a row
Aggressions send out with might,
We will darken the light
Gotta meet a new friend, I need to speak
I'm talking to you, because I'm so confused, I am insane
Somewhere I heard, we will soon come to war. What to do?
So, join our secret circle
Now, come into resistance!
Please don't judge me
For I'm too scared
But who'll take care of my dears?
So untrue brave new world seems to me, mankind's cruel
Soon we'll reciprocate kill each and all
Need to do anything, there must be a way out of disaster
World still turns 'round but how far can we go? - I don't know
So, join our secret circle
Now, come into resistance!
Please don't judge me
For I'm too scared
But who'll take care of my love?
I see a coming hell - earth will release the dead
I feel the pain of all you - who are condemned to death
I feel the loneliness - of those who are left home
God is already gone from us
Back into nothingness
Please don't judge me for I'm too scared
I cannot leave my dears alone
Please don't judge me for I'm too scared
I'm not alone - alone


A mind full of haunted shadows
Keeps away the painful sleep
Light a candle for the sacred moment
Needless thoughts are in to deep
Scary pictures behind the curtain
Burn my eyes and melt the tears
Loneliness in a hidden chamber
Unlock the doors to forgotten fears
There is nothing left to take
All I do is lay awake
B e n e a t h t h e s i l e n c e


My dear wife, seems my life is over
without you
I dream of you in every glacial night,
that I'm alone
You're so far away from the thundering guns
round my head - so far

I feel your tears
Dropping slowly down on my skin
I can taste your lips on mine
Let me kiss you before I must die

Oh, my love, what has been done to us?
Or was there anything - I could have done?
Your tears are the ocean,
that spends love and hope and faith -
for my wounded heart - to heal

I feel your tears
Drying away off my skin
The shine within your eyes
Will soon enlighten my night

But still I'm fighting
But still I'm bleeding
See their dying eyes and suffering
OH my love, I need to kill

Believe in me, I promise you,
I soon will close my arms around you

But still I'm killing
And still I'm bleeding
I suppose to see, there's nothing real
The answer might once be found in me


I need you
I'll lead you
I'll thrill you
I'll kill you
I'll lead you out of the night
That once has fallen upon us
Revenge for the stab with a dagger
Right into our shieldless back
Do you agree when I say expulsion?
Do you agree to wipe them out?
Do you mind the voice of the world?
Or will you follow each command?
One heart, one soul
One man to lead you into your
Salvation, domination,
We can rule the world forever
I need you - like the air I'm breathing day by day
I'll lead you - my lambkins, my dear children
I'll thrill you - I?m the twilight of the gods
I kill you - as I will die for you
Now you believe every word I say
Now you're puppets in my hands
Do you remember, I'd asked you once
If you will follow me even into death
Now, here's your ultimate chance
To take your oath, you've sworn on me
Don't pray to God for he is dead
A new Messiah has captured your minds
One folk, one lord
One man to lead you into your
Salvation, extermination
We will change the world forever
I'm your leader, I'm your lord
Am I human or divine?


When the sun rises slowly and the haze fades away
Everyone knows that the time has come close
To be the first in line with the rifle in our hands
You and I, my old friend, will we ever die?


See the fire, feel the pain,
The blood runs cold through our veins
No mercy will reflect in our eyes
United with the cold steel of death in our hands
Let them pay for the crimes, they have done
Crush their cities, burn down their lodgings,
Allow no one to survive
Or their revenge will eradicate
Your children's lives
Be prepared for the moment,
when you'll meet your maker
And his reaper has become your own life taker
Oh, here I stand and I swear, it's your word that I bear
And I'll scream it out for everyone to hear
I will fight not asking why, I will rub out every lie
For your law, oh my Lord, I'm prepared to die
See an arm, see a leg
Torn apart the rest
That's been you my friend
Just seconds ago
How many tears are left to cry
How many lives are left to die
Who'll answer me now after you've closed your eyes?
Oh here I stand and I swear, I'll damn your word I still hear
And I'll scream it out for everyone to hear
I will not fight four your lie, why you want us all to die?
For your law, oh you beast, we've been sacrificed


Retread - lay down the row
That I've been told to fight,
- For whom?
The child in me is dead,
Innocence is lost,
Ripped out of my heart,
- By whom?
I've found my way;
So I thought and so I hardly tried
my whole life
Or could I have failed?
Oh, "Lord" watch over me
So I prayed each night
And believed to do the right
How could "He" fail?
Too dull - to open my eyes
Too blind - look, what's behind
Too vain - to confess my own lie
Pain - through which hell we have gone
Pain - into void we were thrown
Pain - we brought and we suffered
Pain - mankind went insane
Pain - there's no way to undo
Pain - 'cos I followed you too

ANGEL DUST LYRICS


Frightened Shadows
Appear behind the light
And the coldness seizes me
A paralyzing pain catches me again
Can anybody tell me what's going on
Another day is over
see horror on the screen
The shadows gonna
touch my heart
A skeleton hand
that bears all the grief
Does lightly stroke my sleeping emphaty

Can I leave and close my eyes
for one more night
Can I pay to be set free
of all this pain
That makes me bleed

Gotta meet the pries
and ask for his help
Will the collection
heal my soul
Can money clear the temple
of prejudice and lies
Can I reach heaven and enter paradise



Love and faith
Future and hope
Never appear in their lives
Has all guilt been payed
by the death of christ
Or is there something to apologize




Blue sky- the sun is shining bright
Silence- the noises crystalsed
Freezing when you feel the frantic form
Breathe in the revenge for ancient sins

Black- ancient poser
Black- creeping hazard
Black- out of darkness
Black- black rain

Falling rain washed away the light
No excuse can justify the pain

Black- ancient power
Black- creeping hazard
Black- out of darkness
Black- black rain


Horror in my eyes
I don't know whats going on
List in hell
Nothing remains the same
Creatures of the night
arise in me
Darkness around me
Encourages their evil deeds

I feel my mind
is leaving me
I will follow into eternity

A light shines on me
I feel the sun arise
Fire will banish my fear
My dreadful
black dreams
No longer they'll
scare me
Until the night returns

How long can I stand
The return of
the eternal curse
Deliver me of all the pain
The fear of the dusk
paralyses me




Black is the jail of my soul
In my haunted nights




Do you remember -
a walk along the river
In the valley of our dreams
Forgotten problems -
they've darkened the horizon
Life's no more what it seems
The other side of pain
is rising high again
And makes me cry

So why don't you follow me?
Why don't you follow me?

Forgotten promises -
just flow within the water
Rememberance - just fades away
Echoes of a perfect love
Hurt just like a force
from high above



Times are changing -
life has just begun
There are new aims to be found
Different valleys
Sweeter dreams
Now I know new love
I found my way




Hate - memories tear me apart
Live - never thougt it wold be that hard
Time - always knew on my side
Death - seems to be the only bride

'Cause you didn't follow me
'Cause you didn't follow me

Love - a never unknown feeling I lost
Pain - I never thought I'd count the cost
Feel - you finally made me loose it
Mind - I think you gotta prove me



Somebody to catch my fall
Somebody to close the distance
In my circle of tragedy
Somebody to share my sorrow
Somebody who I believe in
Somebody to follow me

Do you remember - a walk along the river
In the valley of our dreams
The other side of pain is rising high again
And makes me cry



Forgotten problems they've darkened
the horizon
Life's no more what it seems
The other side of pain is rising high again
And makes me cry




Here I am
Just a poor boys dream
My life's lost in trouble
You know what I mean
Knowing the gutter
There ain't no escape
Life has no offers just my body is raped

All my broken promises
Intentions that have failed
Helped me cross the borderline
All the screaming memories
That I wasted in my life
Creeping death is gonna shine

I am lost but I will find
Just a little piece of mind
To keep my self back in control
Will it ever be the same
The syrenge is calling out my name
See myself I am addicted
To serenity

Wasted time
For a shot to come
The bigger they are
The more I'm done
Sacred feelings
There ain't no return
Suicide solution
In hell I will burn





I still heart the tales
That often have been told
I hardly tried to listen
Discover word of gold
Knowledge ain't wisdom
But led you through your life
And all I ask you for
is let me live mine

I hear a voice
From deep inside - open your eyes
The truth of one is
another book of lies

From birth till death
There's a road for everyone
Easy to survey so easy to run
But all simplicity might be a lie
And your grave was digged
Long before you die

Those words of stone
decay so soon
Your truth ain't mine
Why're you so sure you're divine
My life- just a cesspool of lies
My life- anyone could supply
My life- ignorance with no remorse

Beat me - treat me
Respect I am silent
And deaf of all those
curent instructions
That you - spit on - me
Imagine I am one
Just like you who believes
It's worth to besome one
Of love - of faith - and pride
Do you believe that your god
Is anybetter than mine
Are you sure it's his will
My kind - is the next one - to die

Surrender - why do you think I should
Surrender - do you belive I ever could
Surrender - to make you believe I'm fine
Surrender - this ain't a term of mine

Wars have already been tought
No one is left to die
Have you come to an answer
Who's better you or I
A voice breakes the silence
And tells the only truth
That will last forever
My word for my own life




Sanity fades with every breath I take
I'm drowning in shadows
on the way to my fate
None of your words will ever
reach me again
I'm drowning in shadows
I'm calling your name
Now here I stand in a shade
of my dream
I start to forget that you
blame it on me
You don't know if you're right
It's just hatred you see

When the night falls down on me
This is the time where I can see
I need no longer run away
When the night falls down on me
All of my sadness disapears

Still I am disdained by you
Still I am blamed by you
Color me black till I hate forever
Hate me till I hate my self forever



Now I know I'm still alone
And have to face the light
No escape - I have to stay
And hear your abscent cries
My memories are fading away
Desperation will end




Once againthe pictures
disarray
No more empty words
that go astray
Paralize I step into
the stream
Hoping all my lies
will follow me

I feel the dawn rise in me
The light disappears
I start to regret
I can't breake these chains
I die to live again

Ever so I try to turn arround
Electrifying voices
tie me down
My senses are erased
I'm breathing in the flames
The termination has begun
I cannot break these chains

ANGEL DUST LYRICS


I'm trying to think
But I can't catch my thoughts
Confusion is reigning my mind

The void in your word
Should cause me to fear
The coldness is getting near

Clear my eyes
Let me see
I'm going to lose my aim
Show me the sense

The propecies are raining, down from the sky
But answers are not to be found

The longing for something that we cannot find
Uncovers our fatal disguise

Clear my eyes
Let me see
I'm going to lose my aim
Show me the sense

Let me fall
Let me dream - of beauty and truth -
Let me feel
Let me see - the border of reality

Now that we all have percieved our fate
Reality lies and the lie lives in me
Is it all over or will it go on
I'm surewe have nothing to fear


How do you feel, do you feel real good?
Well, I do not believe
Cos you seem to be someone else
Than you pretend to be

Something crept into your mind
Nimble as a snake
It sells you shit for truth
And you'll never recognice

No more .......

Do you wonder all the pain
That is hidden within steel
I'll tell you for nothing
You only fear yourself

No more ................. no more faith

Love or hatred
Pain or pleasure
No escape from your sentimental treasures
Better face the truth

All the money that you spend
For beautycreams and masks
Will never ever hide the scars
That lies left on your face

No more .................. no more faith
No more .................. no more faith


Listen my children,
Listen what your lord's gonna say
I hear you praying me day by day
I know that you believe in me, the only truth
You're the deciples of knowledge
All elder and youth

And I will eat up your minds
And swollow your souls
There ain't no escape
From the mechanical claws

I'm just your only nightmare
Etched in your mind
I'm just your only nightmare
And I'll be back night after night

Listen everyone
To what your lord's gotta say
There ain't no sinners
You all know waht is to do

And I'll will eat up your minds
And swallow your souls
There ain't no escape
From the mechanical claws

I'm just your only nightmare
Etched in your minds
I'm just your only nightmare
And i will come bach - every night


Born in a time,
That you can't remember
World was like hell,
From sky rained fire
Created to fight and to koll
Till just one survives
To rule the world in the end
Is our final aim

We walked thru' the times
Like the wind thru' your hair
And you don't know
That we're at your side

We'll gather one day
In a secret place
And battle to the last
To fulfill detiny

Century to century
We ride on the light
From century to century
We fight to survive

Then me and the beast
Stand face to face -
Just the clash of the swords
Is reaching my ears
The strongest of all -
Is now in my hand Time has come -
To take his head

We walked thru' the times
Like the wind thru' your hair
And you don't know
That we're at your side

We'll gather one day
In a secret place
And battle to the last
To fulfill detiny

Century to century
We ride on the light
From century to century
We fight to survive


How far is the world, in the end?
Is there a judge? Who decides,
What is wrong and what is right?

Who'll be there, in the end?
Who'll be with me, to be without me?

Is there semething, behind the final curtain?
Will there be anyone, any memories?
When my time has come,
to pass the gate to all eternity

Who'll wait for me
To guide me over, into the unknown?

When I die and leave the world behind
When I die

Day after day, I followed the words
That say, I shall be modest and brave
And I sometimes wonder
How I can be so strong

Now here I stand, who'll hold my hand
How here I stand and wait

Now when your day has come
And all life has passed thru?
When memories fade away
And destiny becomes true
When judgement day has been reached
And it finally comes to an end
You'll come to your redemption
Or to pain that never ends!

Oh, I know there'll be no pain
'Cos my soul is as white as snow

No one's there, to warm my hand
When it gets cold
An apparatus sound is reaching my ears
Bright neon light blinds my eyes

A dark veil setz slowly down on me
I go into the void




Try to keep the distance,
Since you threw my life away
My courage into pieces
I couldn't make you stay

Hate, pain and tears
Life can be a tragedy

Dreams becoming nightmares,
Some visions left behind
What could have been,
What cold have last?
You're always on my mind

Love, joy and laughter,
Life can be a miracle

And my heart made of steel,
But my soul turns to stone
And I'm going where no one goes
I carry my load, I'm walking alone
I'm crying, where the wind blows

Lovers score and lovers fail,
Here ain't no compromise
Back to back and face the future
It's a devil in disguise

Fear, darkness and vain
Life can be a deadly maze

And my heart made of steel,
But my soul turns to stone
And I'm going where no one goes
I carry my load, I'm walking alone
I'm crying, where the wind blows








Visions - I'm not awake - nor do I sleep
Dreamin' dawn turns to dusk
Dwarves and fairies dance on my grave
There's a door to - wonderland

Fires, see fires darken the night
Brightness, dark brightness
Trapped in a hot air balloon

I can't believe it
But I believe it`s true

There's a shark
Climbing thru' my heart

Stars shine when the moon heat
Cools my thoughts
The still of the night is so noisy

All faked or true
Tell me - what I will see
Is there a new world
To be found - behind the mirror

Wake up - open me eyes
Light a cigarette and smoke
Smell the taste of coffee
Am I back to wonderland?


Here I am - back from nowhere
I don't remember - everything
I've gone too far
There ain't nothing left

It started so softly -
Couldn't feel anything at all
Ther was no euphoria -
Reality was so close

Then fellows and me -
We tripped day by day
To visit the new world -
For the old did decay ...

My soul's flown away -
Left an empty space
I took a view into hell -
But I'm coming home
Slave me ...

Mother - please believe me
I never want you to die
Father, forgive me
Your memory lives in me

My soul's flown away -
Left an empty space
I took a view into hell -
But I'm coming back alive ...

I'm coming home
I'm coming home
Please believe me
I'm coming home
Deliver me ...

ANGEL DUST LYRICS




There is a land in the middle east region
ruled by black gold
and a crazy religion
There is a satan with certain charisma
he instigates thousands to play the Kamikaze game
the tyrant has the power of words
His bible is built on barbaric foundations
laws from a forgotten century that live again
to die is a straight way to glory
Black widows march proclaim their own slavery
and even children grow to fighters in war
David fights Goliath Uncle Big Satan
the banner of the holy warblood for bloodlife for life
Mr Inferno he is responsible
makes the blood boil in the veins of his land
Mr. Inferno he is responsible
Holding the lifes of his man in his hands
A hellish old man plans the overkill riot
he letz his land bleed till end in a war for his pride
it's his demonstration of might
The distinguised expression on face of the old man
his hiding ideas full of madness for adamned deadly game
We won't retain to fight it back
save the ballance land he rules
We'll hold the power on the border
they've sworn the oat
hand die on his order
Mr. Inferno he is responsible
makes the blood boil in the veins of his land
Mr. Inferno he is responsible
Holding the lifes of his man in his hands
So it's destroyed the work of a century
the iron towers melt down in the fire of hate
No survivor in a war out of gain
pain or glory described in the book of all fates
Mr. Inferno he is responsible
makes the blood boil in the veins of his land
Mr. Inferno he is responsible
Holding the lifes of his man in his hands

He is responsible


Can you hear the rolling thunder
pounding through the sky
gods revenge will always find you
when you hide in the night
there is no forgiveness for you
when you pray down on your knees
you've got to fight to fight the slavery
in the bad dimension heat
You've got wingswings of an angel
yeah you've got wings
wings of an angel
To take you to the stars
to take you on your last fight
they're taking you so high
higher & higher & higher & higher & higher
taking you higher
taking you high
Then you meet the evil wizzard
to sell him heart and soul
you should escape from this dimension
before you're getting cold
there'll be no forgiveness for you
when you pray down on your knees
and when the angels sing of glory
you're lost in deepest haze
To take you to the stars
to take you on your last fight
they're taking you so high
higher & higher & higher & higher & higher
taking you higher
taking you high
Thunderbolts are striking
your sword with golden blade
you feel you bleed so badly
but you're fighting till the end
there is no forgiveness for you
when you pray down on your knees
and when the angels sing of glory
you're lost in deepest haze
You've got wings
wings of an angel
yeah you've got wings
wings of an angel
Wings of an angel
taking you high to the sky
Wings of an angel
so you can fight the slavery



Rising from the night of time
rising from damnation
growing furtive to old size
a thousand years old nation
Finding victims for their "Reich"
the lands' got a lot of strangers
they call back the crystal night
to burn the war creation
In a land where neighbours are stranger
sand misleaded feel caled for avenger
sin a land with blood
covered history
Then the last man of their kind
finished life in prison
he's a martyr for their aims
started killing seasons
Now they march the insane hords
call the "Neo-Nation"
again the right hands risen high
a skinny revelation
In a land where neighbours are stranger
sand misleaded feel caled for avenger
sin a land with blood
covered history
Back to the dark
Rising their hands higher
Back into the past
from the night of time
Banned graphitti on the walls
words of hate and murder
waiting for their masters call
back in line and order
In a land where neighbours are strangers
Back to the dark
Rising their hands higher
Back into the past
from the night of time
Back to the dark
Rising their hands higher
Back into the past
from the night of time


Seventh day restless I wait
yes I wait for the right word
twelve o'clock this is my time
time to change to the nightbird and like
a snake I am winding myself into tight jeans
the look on my face's gonna make all the
girls know what I mean
I come in the music stops
and you see everyone turning
then I walk cool as I can
straight to the bar and start smoking
I feel hot looks in my back
and I'll soon chose my victim
I am the king and my right is to show you
what I need
You know here I am again
it's my show
now I'm back on the road
so show action and go
I think of the time that I waisted
how can you tell till you've tasted?
Why nobody told me I'm wrong
I can not be
can not be king all my life

My straight face is lying about motions
that live in my heart
like a figure of stone
I am waiting for you to start
You know here I am again
it's my show
now I'm back on the road
I think of the time that I waisted
how how can you tell till you've taisted?
why nobody told me I'm wrong
I can not be
can not be king all my life


You're running into tragedy
signs announcing danger
for your life
will end in agony
and your bodies will decay to dust
Dust you are created of
and eternal laws can never change
change in our universe
dust to dust decays
You'll roast in flames
with the soals fo no name
your bones burste under mountains of bones
A voice from some
whereis calling your name
when you're in league with the gods
Pray
Or to dust you will decay
pay attention to my warning
Pray
Or to dust you will decay
on a painfull morning
To dust you will decay
Everything that you achieved
all you tried has been in vain
you're treated with indignity
somewhere in a nowhere you will
fight
for the right to survive
don't blasphemise the holy signs
who will you bein the judgment of gods
after the night when you'll die
who will you bein the judgment of gods
after the night when you'll die
Pray
Or to dust you will decay
pay attention to my warning
Pray
Or to dust you will decay
on a painfull morning
To dust you will decay
you will decay


Somewhere on a border
forced to march in line and order
looo men in greedy hands
Lured with hope for future
pressed in contracts
leaving them no chance
but to leave their land
They're nameless young men
bleeding their hands
on the edge of life
and they feel the hate
treated like slaves
There's a shanty village
where they are folded in dirt
dirt and a mess
intimidations breaking
the free will of men
free will of men
free will of men
Stranger
Stranger from a foreign land

Somewhere in a office
noble looking and expensive
accepted by a corrupt state
Stranger
Stranger from a foreign land

Locked in a cage
tied with invisible chains
on iron walls of pain
faces expressing their torture
denying their age
1000 years
reflected in mirrors of eyes
and brain
flowing rage
a rage crushing in fragments
past recorgnition their mind
Stranger
Stranger from a foreign land
Stranger
Stranger from a foreign land



Back to back here we stand
our guns they are ready and loaded
ten steps forward and then turn
the strike of the bullets will hurt you
Eye to eye with icecold looks
that make you feel there is danger
they have might to hypnotize
and they will never release you
You search for the stronger
you search for the truth
you're searching so long
wasting your youth
Fight it out
if you search for the stronger
fight it out if you search for the truth
fight it out if you search for the stronger
fight it out if you search
Search for the stronger of two
Keep cool bleed and fight your fear
Success's laying only in your hands
just try hard the end is near
your name will be sung through the lands
You search for the stronger etc ...
Fight it out
if you search for the stronger
fight it out
etc ...


You ride on a silver spider
captured in his net
and your prince rides beside you
he knows no way to help
You walk through tubes of mistery
you see light at the end
but when you reach the exit
your're cought by thousand hands
You ride on a silver spider
captures in his net
and your prince rides beside you
he knows no way
You fall pictures create the lies
You fall but your mind denies
Hold on don't you lose your dreams
Hold on save your fantasy
Hold on every nightmare's got an end
don't you lose your dreams tonight
In the night
You sail on a purple ocean
the wind inflates your wings
burned by an old emotion
your wooden sailboat sinks
When flames of memory touch you
you'll see they've burned so long
and deep in a nest in side you
another dream is born
You fall ...
Hold on ...
You ride on a silver spider ...
Hold on don't you lose your dreams
Hold on save your fantasy
Hold on every nightmare's got an end
Hold on save your fantasy
Hold on save dreams for me
Hold on every nightmare's got an end

ANGEL DUST LYRICS


I’ve been working hard, working hard up to now
But now you kick my ass
Put me down, on the street
I’m sleeping on the sidewalk
Got no food for tomorrow
And if I stole an apple
I’d be damned in your eyes
But I’ll come back
Some day, one day
Got to debt to pay
I’ll come back
Don’t look around
Some day, one day
I’ll be standing there
When I’m back
I’ve bled my hands to repair your big car
Working night and day
To make your ship and your steel
You said I’m no one without your help
I’ll show you soon
That I’m not your fool
You’re down on me
Screwed my brain, till it hurt
You broke my soul, ‘cause I needed a job
But you must realize you drove me insane
You can’t go this way any longer anymore


It must happened in another time
In another place called ‘FAAR’
The sky was red and cloudless
Darkness blocked out the stars
It was a time of pain and death
When only the bad did survive
When you had, what you possessed
Was a weapon and your life
Just a few were strong enough
To play the deadly game
Against the legions of death
The legions of destruction
It must happened in another time
In another place called ‘FAAR’
A bloody tyrant
Leads the fates of ‘FAAR’
The legions obey his command
To spread his reign of terror
Up and down the land
At the risk of their lives
Hit and run in the night
At the risk of their lives
Sworn to die, kill and fight


He’s just a gambler
Like everybody, too
He plays in smoky backrooms
He plays the odds like you
All he trusts is luck
His only guarantee
He gambler till the end
He looses more than he will ever win
(He plays like you like me)
GAMBLER – you’re playing with fire
GAMBLER – it’s a cheaters liar
GAMBLER – you stake all you got
GAMBLER – this game is too hot
This game is too hot
Win
Lose
Inside & cage
Win
Loose
You’ll win no gain
The trick of a card
You hold in your hand
May blind your eyes
When you have an ace
Then you need a spade
Don’t play with fire


Fighting my fight to survive
I’ll never compromise
I’ll take your lives
You better get out of my way
I’ll go through hell
I’ll fight till the end
I’m ready to strike
I’ll make you run
You’ll run for your life
But you cannot hide
This is the fighters return
Cities will burn
Watch out
I’ll be bullet in your heads
You cannot provoke me any longer
You screwed me up, now expect my revenge
You brought that shit upon you
I’m your executioner
And my wrath will be my gun
I’ll make no prisoners
I will make you run
I asked for your help
But you pushed me back
I needed your love
You offered me hate
I’m only defending my life
You want to destroy me forever


See the light of oppression
Talk to the witches because
We’ve broken the sword of salvation
Finery rain is falling

No one knows how it will be
In disaster and disease
Atomic Roar
Destroying the souls
Destroying their lives
March of the night
Marches on

Who can stop him riding?
See the circles of his bows
Death of steel and iron
Blowing like a storm
Enemies of living black
Children of their souls
Burning back you and me
Who want to be free?
Darkness comes before midnight
Fire burning out of hell
Have you seen the nation?
Here comes atomic roar

No one knows how it will be
In disaster and disease
Atomic Roar
Destroying the souls
Destroying their lives
March of the night
Marches on

See the light of oppression
Talk to the witches because
We’ve broken the sword of salvation
Finery rain is falling

No one knows how it will be
In disaster and disease
Atomic Roar
Destroying the souls
Destroying their lives
March of the night
Marches on

Who can stop him riding?
See the circles of his bows
Death of steel and iron
Blowing like a storm
Enemies of living black
Children of their souls
Burning back you and me
Who want to be free?


He comes out from nowhere
To seize power for himself
He knows how to seize the might
Enough power to start the fight
It’s exactly the right time
To realize his plans
Plans for another world war
Now he sees his chance
Madness – he is totally insane
Madness – the only word to describe this man
Madness – only few know what he’s gonna do
Madness – but its too late
No one can stop him on his way to the top
Not many foresee the disaster
But their hands – are bound
And their mouths – have been shut
By the legions of all around
We’re all going to be
Victims of Madness
Victims of Madness again
Madness – again there’ll be total war
Madness – death in the atomic roar
Millions – destroyed in a senseless war
Millions – crippled by a degrading life
He comes out upon us from the void
To seize the power to himself
He knows the way to occupy the might
Enough power to start a global fight
He’s promising heaven but he’s planning hell
His promising visions, put them all under spell
Marching for Revenge
You never asked me if I wanted to be born
And now you tell me how I ought to live
Right from the start you had your plan
Had it all planned from the beginning to the end
I must do what you demand from me
You give me (the) orders – and I have to obey
But it can’t go on that fucking way
Time has come for me to break the chains


To bring it to an end
Fighting for my rights
Fighting to cut my ties
It’s time to start my life anew
I have my own schemes I don’t need your rules
Unlimited freedom will never exist
But after your patter I don’t wanna live
I must do what you demand from me
You give me (the) orders – and I have to obey
(But) I’m not the only one who hates to live that way
Time has come for us to break the chains
Marching for revenge
To bring it to an end
Fighting for our rights
Fighting to cut our ties
I don’t wanna live without a future and aim
I make my own rules just for my own game
I don’t care what you think about this
It’s just my own game I don’t wanna miss

ANGEL DUST LYRICS


Libera me,
De morte aeterna,
In die illa tremenda
Quando coeli movendi sunt et terra,
Dum veneris judicare
Saeculum per ignem
Tremens factus sum ego, et timeo
Dum discussio venerit



Deliver me,
From eternal death,
On that fearful day
When the heavens are moved and the earth
When thou shalt come to judge
The world through fire
I am made to tremble, and I fear,
When the desolation cometh


Solitude's my epitaph
I've been dying within
Secrets kept inside tattoed my skin
Still darkness dwells in me

Born in everlasting mists
Endless quest for truth I am
In the shrine of gloom I cry

Chase the dark
Bring the end
Stormcloud winter is my reign
Against the coldest winds I run
Alone until the day I die

I'm alone

From the abyss came forth my love
Never meant to be real
From the embers of my soul to you
Drifts me far away

Fading echoes
Havoc revealed
No more concealed by
An ephemeral life
What makes a man try to fight for absolution?
Show him the flame
Then let him set himself on fire

In astral silence we stand
I feel your grief in me
To cherish all your tears
I'm here with you now

Trapped beyond my inner doubts
I've been searching in vain
Now the answers lie behind these staves
The path I walk is my own

Born in everlasting mists
Endless quest for truth I am
In the shrine of gloom I cry

Chase the dark
Bring the end
Stormcloud winter is my reign
Against the coldest winds I run
Alone until the day I die


The raven's lonely flight
The throne where you're supposed to be
It's just a thorn, a crime
There's no forgiveness

This is all my spirit has
A sacred place for you and me
Forgotten and betrayed
I tried to hold it

This crystal grave was built for you
Of haze as wolves cried to the moon
This dying rose I give to you
It's made of my blood?
Now it belongs to you

The velvet kiss of rain
The moment when the angels sing
You did it all in vain
Nothing's there for you

High is the price I have to pay
My sin was to behold your eyes
When darkness blinds the day
So cruel and distant

It seems you don't understand
That the gods don't need your cries
You've kissed her hand for the last time
The last time, my son

Wake frozen dusk, haven of souls
Tear up my heart, your sign will rise
Black corvine eyes wait as my hope
Silently dies... now

Death and love dance in your name
Like tears in the stream
Both the hunter and the prey
Fell in love with the knife's blade

I will search for you forever in this maze
I won't break this vow

This crystal grave was built for you
Of haze as wolves cried to the moon
This dying rose I give to you
It's made of my blood?
Now it belongs to you
As shades are gathering
Around our hearts

The seventh circle in darkness is rising
The circle is rising
Now the source is dying down


I've found that silver knife
Laying heartless in my palm
Your blood doesn't stain its blade
Who are you?

Angelique, show me the way
The way out of here
Let me reach for your beauty again
Angelique, show me the way
The way out of here
Like a shadow your vision's in me

I've got to kill a man who killed death
I've got to kill... The Man Who Killed Death

You've taken her from me
I'll give you hell for it
Don't say she's just my dream
... is this real?

A new world, gold-shining
A hope beyond this land
An angel, gold-shining
Salvation in her eyes...

A new lie, gold-shining
A puppet in their hands
Illusions, gold-shining
Created in your mind

I've got to kill a man who killed death
I've got to kill... The Man Who Killed Death

There's a darkened space inside me
Made of memories of you
The trail you left behind
Those seven doors I'll walk through
Out of this wasted land... to you

Give me strength to break the gates
Beyond the sky
Where your soul remains still
Far from the dome of life and death
I'm still with you

Angelique, show me the way
The way out of here
Let me reach for your beauty again
Angelique, show me the way
The way out of here
Like a shadow your vision's in me


Don't speak so bravely about death
It's just another empty word to me
Created by weak souls and dreaming fools like you
I'm not the one to fear
I shouldn't be your enemy
But be aware of what I say
Or we'll play my game

The ages rise and fall before me
One thousand times I've seen your suffering
A reason to live for
...Or a lie to fight for?
The way to wisdom is a weapon
The seven secrets are eternal might
But maybe it's just your mind
Playing tricks on you

I know that she is nigh
The chalice takes me high
I feel the living stars
The universe aligned
Oh... the infinity
Angelique...

Angelique
Come to me
Embrace my pain
It can't be the last time
Angelique
I bleed for you
Please don't go

I've got to kill a man who killed death
I've got to kill... The Man Who Killed Death


For the last time I am alone
For the last time It feels so cold
It's the last time
Now she has gone

But then... the sky answers

Rain
Rain is falling down on me
Here comes the rain

For a moment I hear a prayer
Just a moment but It's so clear
You're calling me
You're touching me
Oh it hurts deep down

Your soul is so lost without me
But I can't recall your eyes
Oh... hold me and kiss me
Please take me with you

Frail threshold of sanity
The nightmare became so real
But all the tears,
The pain we feel
Are washed by the...

Rain
Rain is falling down on me
Here comes the rain
For the last time


Step back! The trees guard the way
And the wind's full of voices no soul's ever heard
They sing forever their secret tale
On this place blessed by nightfall they embrace your gait

I've walked across all forests
Their beauty is killing me

For those who'll never see the mountains
Forever my eyes have been broken
For those who'll never see the mountains
Forever my soul has been broken
It's broken down

You've felt the beating
Under the barks
Those who were silent (You've chosen to wander)
Now chant loud in you (Forlorn? Lost?)

This time the breeze won't take their pain from me
This time I want their tears to stay in my heart

I cry for those who'll never see the mountains
Forever my eyes have been broken
I cry for those who'll never see these mountains
Forever my soul has been broken
It's broken down


Immortal name, immortal fame
His face will be wherever you are
Awake the wolf that's on your heart
It will protect your deepest desires

Have you ever felt that rain?
Water flowing through its veins
I cry feeding its fate
Inside your dreams

The shadow will roam till death embraces your soul
Dawn will come, dream this night
Alone with your tears, alone with your fears
Lost in memories you have just lived

On this rainy night I pray
To find you one day
Show me the way I must walk
In this humid shelter I pray
To feel you again
And to discover your light

Growing life beside your life
Eternal cycle under the skies
Sometimes the bright snows refresh its skin
Watch Spring weaving the silk
Enchanted by delightful charm
Sometimes its Autumn leaves caress the air


I know it's time to kill the sickness from my soul
My eyes have seen too many things never seen before
I know it's time to feed the viper in my soul
I know it's my turn to take control
Now!

Something inside is devouring my rotten core
I feel it clear, soft lips of a whore
Twisting my mind into ashes
Into ashes I fall
Can't bear this suffocation

It is the warmth of the hemlock on virgin skin
- Respire the disease
It is the book where all truth is spoilt
- Crawl into light
It is the lust of illusion
- Ecstasy is yours
It's a worm called mankind
But now I have awoken

Falseness tempting me wherever my way goes
In this baneful sea I am
As the world sleeps down in trance, my vision grows
I still stand sober and cold

The tempest crosses skies, eternal
I hear its painful call inside of me
The tempest crosses skies, eternal
I hear its silent cry:
Death to the world!

Oh The air is so cold tonight
It saves me from their white masquerade
I can see them now I know they're afraid, yes
And the poisonous seed still tries to swallow my soul
But I'm not weak anymore

Defy them Crystal Mind
You're not one of them
Tellurian sight Cursed one

Carving a hole in my spirit
Gliding unseen like a spider in black
It pours my blood as I struggle for some air to breathe
To breathe this choking sulphur

It is the pyre that lights the blind's way
- Dance in the flames
It is the garden in bloom where lovers die
- Caress the blade
It is the parasite
- Let senses fly
But I'm out of its reach
Its antidote I am

The tempest crosses skies, eternal
I hear its painful call inside of me
The tempest crosses skies, eternal
I'll be its silent cry:
Death to the world!


The world stopped
A raindrop fell over your cheek
As winds off shore caressed your hair
I knew the mastery of pain

Like the cold snow shelters the evergreen leaves
Just before the sun takes it away
So our time won't last for evermore
But don't fear the night
The essence never dies

Don't you see that our love is real
In your eyes, beyond this life
Don't you see that this love is real
In your eyes, it will never die

I wish this could be true
The mastery of pain

Inside
The essence never dies
Deep inside
The essence never dies

Please don't give me more thoughts pure
I don't want anything but you
Please don't leave this world of doom
I can't live without your voice
You're a fire in the sky
I will crush heavens to dust
'Cause I need your love - I need you
I need you to be free - I need you

Don't you see that our love is real
In your eyes, beyond this life
Don't you see that this love is real
In your eyes, it will never die

Inside
The essence never dies
Inside
The essence never dies

I wish this could be true...


Surrounded by the ocean wind
Mortal Silence takes me
Over my lonely trail

Reddish sand is hiding the trace
Taken by the traveller god

Empty eyes fixed on a tragedy
Mirrored from a distance beside you

Reddish sand is hiding the trace
Taken by the traveller god

Follow the chain one more autumn
I never wanted to lose my faith
But still tomorrow
Another link will join this endless chain

I can see you
Roaming through the track
Like a Timewalker
yearning for his time

Make for the chain end
Out of this world
Reliving grief and madness
Wishing to stay
Embraced by the sea

Follow the chain one more autumn
I never wanted to lose my faith
But still tomorrow
Another link will join this endless trail of sorrow


Waiting under starlight
To feel your white shining
My life has no meaning
Without dreaming of you

This is the circle where souls bleed for love
Inside this circle we die now

Seven demons from heaven
Wings of a raven in descent
I was just a weak pawn
With a heart torn for you

This is the circle where souls bleed for love
Inside this circle we die now
This is the circle where all hopes are lost
Inside this circle we die now

Crossing through the archway
Seven are gathered here
The cloister vibrates with the sound

This score is a path that
leads me astray from you
Please forgive what I have to do

In quo est salus, vita, et resurrectio

This is the circle where souls bleed for love? for you
This is the circle where all hopes are lost
Inside this circle we die now

Cursed by the light, Damned by the night





Then, today you shall die
and you'll never see this night
As the dusk falls your life shall disappear

I see you walk to me
As if you were in a dream
Kneel before the truth
Ends with the lie

This is the end
The dark awaits
In darkness

ANGELDARK LYRICS





Antichrist!

Hail Blasphemy Geared for battle
This call to arms, wrath and war
Victory or death is on the march
Antichrist allegiance the only law

Assail the gates of hypocrisy
Wield the weapons of Antichrist
Destroy ideologies of excrement
Antichrist Vanguard

Heretic pact attack of steel
Eradication of false culture
Liquidation of the slave creed
Annihilation - vae victis

Like a sun drenched black with angel's blood
My hate burns fierce and proud
My heart and kind seek retribution
And the sight of human vermin crucified

Antichrist!

King of slaves
Plains of the impaled
Blood stained temples
Horizons ablaze
Ensanguined blades of execration
Blackened fields of decimation

Wield the weapons of Antichrist [x2]
Destroy ideologies of excrement

Hail Blasphemy Geared for battle
This call to arms, wrath and war
Victory or death is on the march
Antichrist allegiance the only law

Annihilation - vae victis

Like a sun drenched black with angel's blood
My hate burns fierce and proud
My heart and kind seek retribution
And the sight of human vermin crucified


The maps of old are broken here
In spirit and in flesh
Excise the notions of obeisance
And oblivion from the body, mind, soul
Eclipse the claws of indoctrination
Smash the foes of the faustian flam
The lightning leaps upon my brow
Horned helm black infernal names

Hail the temple of the self - triumphant
Hail the elite breed of man
Unvanquished heathendom paramount
Crush the contagion of Christendom
For this iron folk spearheads destiny
Cursing dispatching that which pollutes
March under command of the conquering
Strike with stalwart vengeance absolute

Antichrist vanguard advance
Spilling the blood of matyrs and slaves
Credo decimatus
Machinery of the cleansing

Decay and degradation dwell amongst us
Machinery of the cleansing
Sepsism swells the flock obscene
Machinery of the cleansing...

Antichrist vanguard advance
Spilling the blood of matyrs and slaves
Credo decimatus
Machinery of the cleansing

The maps of old are broken here
In spirit and in flesh
Excise the notions of obeisance
And oblivion from the body, mind, soul
For this iron folk spearheads destiny
Cursing dispatching that which pollutes
March under command of the conquering
Strike with stalwart vengeance absolute

Machinery of the cleansing...


Accane occltism inscribed in blood
Black arts summon spirits burn within
Arise incubi and succubi
Dmps of the perverse delight in sin
Victorious poisoned ecstasies
Tenebrous wings enshroud proclaim
Evoking the wan beholder of the night
Lust impiety bestial faith


Tragos aperdiomenos
La'ir L'azazael
Lasus Luciferi
La'ir L'azazael

Necromancy from dammation's depths
Exalted invocations praise
Blasphemous orgiastic doom cult
Withered bands of glory blaze
Guardians of the sado catechism
Sorcery of high proscription
Zealous disciples thou shalt suffer
Abhorrence abyssic Desolation



Hexensabbat

Daughters of Lilith plummet ever downwards
Black hearts befoul the wound of Christ
Darkness Drowning witchery crowning
Hexensabbat

Frozen semen frozen stars
Frozen spears of destiny
Hexensabbat blood of menses
frozen semen frozen stars
frozen spear of destiny
hexensabbat Goat of mendes...


Two warring Dragons and Destinies
War Vultures circle strike endlessly
Grim Demolition shrieking without mercy
Spitting steel and slaughter at prey
Decapitated armor broken and battered
Stirring the cauldron smashing to the ground
Infernal ordinance settles like atomic winters
Shall shocked crews scuttle skeletal remains

Iron Litany Bloody Destiny
War is King and father of all

Whirlwinds of smoke and razorfire
Nest of machineguns incendiaries blaze
Men Thrust lurching morbid beyond life
Battering bluntly as beast to the grave
Decimation from the skies blooded torn asunder
Attack attack under withering fire
Advance into cannot splintered
Serpents of Demise
Machines devour men stoke
The Ritual funeral pyre

Iron Litany bloody Destiny
War is king and father of all
Iron Litany bloody destiny
Extermination Sworn

We can see now for the first time
The fundmental things that matter in life
Things that have been obscured from our vision
By the apathy of affluence
The great flood of luxury and sloth
Which baf submerged the land is receding
And a new nation is rising

Through the turmoil of the battlefield
The brotherhood of the people will be strengthened
And a common desire created
To uplift our folk from this diseased age
The great flood of luxury and sloth Which bad submerged the land is receding
And a new nation is rising

Another Rome is crumbling another day is done
Another darkness reckons beyond the setting Sun
What bleak and barren berald holds
Empires to their end
While the Resolute and stalwart
March out to certain death...


Masturbating nun's choir sour and stained
Strains of bymns and bymens ablaze
Dammation Discharged from vessels unsung
The suffocating reels of heavenly cunts
Habits befouled puritanical
Salvation libation gasping for air
Speaking in tongues the body of Christ
Communion servicing on their knees

Belvet walled vagina
Swallows rood and rosary
The word made flesh
Pounds frenzied in rectum divine

Impales mons venus devoured crucifix
Golden fluids streaming into profaned pyr
The three in one trinity ityphallic bost
Fellatio insatiable in greedy throats
Elilepsia feverish caterchismal sodomy
Crimson tears awakened forsaken enjoyed
Sulphurous flames shudder on bare breasts
The kingdom of heaven in every orfice

Belvet walled vagina
Swallows rood and rosary
The word made flesh
Pounds frenzied in rectum divine
Baptism by ejaculation
Blood and offal flow free
Bolutuous supplication
Saints of Blasphemy

Predating
Black wolf six thrice
Malefacting
Gloria in excelsis
Formicating
Destilence arise
Coagulating
Gloria in excelsis

Filth faith disease both rot their flesh
Condeemed to writhe in wretchedness
Stench of salvation delerium obsessed
Funereal paean and noisomeness....


Thrall
idealogical termites
Thrall
Chandala parasites
Thrall
Destilential slave creed
Thrall
Inferior scum breed

The evilfire has rotten from inside
Human maggots spawned into files
Herb mentality the rabble in control
feasting on the feces of existence

Bermin crawling
Filth in its highest form
One can lead a beast to water
But it can't be forced to drink

Thrall
Deification of Decay
Thrall
Morbid Mediocrity
Thrall
Degeneration divine
Thrall
Absolution genocide

Wretched iniquitous wastes
Cadaverous flesh disgraced
Banquished for lack of will
Enslaved the decrepit dwell

Deification of decay
Morbid mediocrity

Monolithic hate Diabolos crowned
The synagogue of Satan nativity in black
Semen datura Tetragrammaton defiled
Sattaru seirizziim the serpent's path

Revel in slaughter fall to fornication
Imbibe the poisons of shadow and plague

Lord of the world ‒ Pater Tenebrarum
Resurrect the throne of solitude and death
Arise great Mother of Abomination
Grim anointing desolation made flesh

Inquisition bloodletting scepters of demise
Awaken ruination degradation and doom

Invoke the fiendish flames of malediction
Shining One (Rex Luciferi)
Plunge the depths of Satan
Satyrs dance and howl
Shining One (Rex Luciferi)

Opus dei ‒ Jehovah hung with nails
Pallid crucifixion symbol of defeat
Scourge sadistic the Nazarene slave
Sever the seraph's golden wings
Sacrilege stalks bloodied streets
Paved with the bones of the dead
Burn to ash the tree of life
Indulge Babylon with sodomy...


In the name of nihilism
I watch her face turning blue
Porcelain demeanor under cellophane
Hate unleashed depravity and pain

Her screams are charnel house symphonies
Death chamber dirges grinding bones to dust
I believe in desecration
Lustmord

Auto asphyx self stimulation
Weltering in torment flesh and terror
With every ecstasy aflame alive
Struggles subside she resigns to die
Rigor mortis cold flesh stiffening
Post mortem desecration
Carving the flesh raping angel's souls
Defile disembowel dissection

Mutilate triumphant shibari in blood
Piano wire ligature body disfigured
Pleasures horrendous grim lost gasps
Torn genitalia garotted suspended

Danse macabre I smash forbidden tombs
To manifest my sadism my morbid fantasies
Evoking obscene wills in the cemetery of my mind
To torture murder rape to purge humanity

I believe in desecration
Lustmord

In the name of nihilism
I watch her face turning blue
Porcelain demeanor under cellophane
Hate unleashed depravity and pain
Decimation prowling violating
Any open window any open house
Lacerating masturbating suffocating
Black seed of hate spills from her mouth...

ANGEL CORPSE LYRICS


Fierce - steel eyed devils
For whom the sun never sets
Proud - Iron youth
Of the noble cultures of the past
Striding - like greyhounds keen
Where glory beckons
Tough as burnished leather
And hard as Krupp's steel

The standard raised we wait
Our comfort - in readiness
The stoicism of the elite
Prepared for the assault at dawn

Elegant - obdurate hearts
A Volk of purity and vigor
Wicked weapons and armed encampment
A phalanx of spears - of dispassion
Bristling - furor teutonics
A steed spurred ever onwards
Action and instinct befitting
In the shadow of the sword

The standard raised we wait
Our comfort- in readiness
The stoicism of the elite
Prepared for the assault at dawn

Death's head empire
Stormgods unbound

The shores of space shall not define
Nor walls thrown up enclose our vault
And as if borne from distant stars
We rage against the bastion of
That which is still unshattered

Fierce- steel eyed devils
For whom the sun never sets
Proud-Iron youth Of the noble cultures of the past
Emblazoned- emboldened
We heathens wild
Stormgods unbound
Beholden to none

Sun wheels expansive
Through thunder and blood bold
Weltmacht oder niedergang
The heaven's charges struggle
Eternally unfold...

Stormgods Unbound


Chaos infinite- majesty of execration
Squatting proud upon the throne of abomination
Death profane burns bright- supreme
Consuming foetid flesh of the nazarene

Rites of scourge- immolated flesh
Imbibe the sorrow storm of impiety
A serpent entwined in the horns of the goat
Of withered angels wretched debris

Smoldering...

Tyrant of solitude and desolate beauty
The scaled and blooded claws of the mighty
A king for kings to victory betrothed
Vestige of mercy with filth befouled

Winged shadow simulacrum
Tenebrous dirge- ensanguined drums of war
Iron, blood and blasphemy affirmation
With grinning sepulchre as altar

He who leaps the loftiest of mountains
Pride and proscription now abhorred
Smoldering in exile- eternal
Azazael: awful lord
The flesh of Besz- venom of Apophrasz
The Dragon steed of the Scarlet Fornicatrix
Behold magnificence: Mega Therion
Six hundred and sixty six

An iron helm on horned brow crowning
A warlord wreathed bold with lightning
Obsidian splendor- of starless purity
The bringer enflamed of dawns and destiny

Of strength, cloven stature and wisdom unknown
The wellspring from which all blasphemies flow
The sadistic triumph for which I yearn
The mighty inferno in which I burn...

Smoldering in exile


Total war witchery damned conjuration
Leather winged covens of death scar the skies
Rivers of fire, blood and defamation
Bloated seas of rage steep fearless eyes

Demonthrong clatter on cloven hoof
Ten thousand exterminating angels
War vomits writhe lust up in the throat
Rended bodies become one with the soils

Bestial storm of mutilation
Reaver
Hail blasphemic revelation

Wicked regent ascends beyond
The crimson breath of chaos
A pestilential gloaming
Borne on scorpion winds

Reaver...

Total war witchery damned conjuration
Leather winged covens of death scar the skies
Rivers of fire, blood and defamation
Bloated seas of rage steep fearless eyes

Obey commands of ritual malevolence
Death and life perverse unite in infamy
The cursed few- proud bestial saviors
Rapture: the rancid flocks perish in vain

Bestial storm of mutilation
Reaver


Suckled at the teat of the she-wolf
I was born in the light of the gibbous moon

Fathered by vengeance and carnal lust
Unholy matrimony of blood and sperm

Wolflust

Shape shift moonlight feral scent
Spurting frothing seed raracious dread

Terror bathing ensanguined venom flows
Parting the flesh of the daughters of men

Wolflust

Beast of raping blood
Pillaging unclean desire
Loathsome hellhound nightmare of death
Where shadows fall-beware

Twilight unscathing
Bloodbath infant rending
A spell a cry from limb from limb
Enter on all fours the witch

The hunger slaked my loins now spent
Silence entombs save for the howling of the damned

Hell has fufilled my blackened destiny
Bestial deeds of hell paced death


There once was a blue-gray wolf
Whom destiny ordained warrior king of the world
Born to the saddle- blacksmith- tyrant to be
In the great valley of Gurvan Nuur
Storming with mane of flame and blood red
A forging of empire, the horder enthroned
Grim century of cruelty, of scourge and war
A man of his time- only more...

Horsemen merciless from the open steppe
Whirlwinds of destruction
A warlord's pursuit of unbridled joy
Of revenge so sweet and subjugation
And for those chafed at the yoke
Blazing arrows, human shields, burning bones
Innocents slaughtered and crushed
Bloodthirsty orgies of extermination

His was the roar of the king of beasts
Of typhoons- and fallen kingdoms and kind
Of ravening- as predator to prey
And of fiercest lightnings divine

He was the punishment (meted out) by th gods
The sanguinary one who scorned defeat
Torn bodies of women, weeping and wailing
Flames devouring the vanquished
Samarkand, Bukhara, Nishapur, Merv
A hundred thousand heads rolling in the dust
Oceans of sacrilege raged and rushed
Eternal sadism's only law

Rape and conquest
Cities to the sword
Atrocity massacre
Temujin

"As a bow lusting for its arrow
And an arrow lusting for its star
With an eagle's talons grasping new life
As a roaring wind that blows my soul bright
For it is blessedness to impress one's hands
Upon millennia as on wax
To etch ideas into men as on steel and stone"

His was the roar of the king of beasts
Of typhoons- and fallen kingdoms and kind
Of ravening- as predator to prey
And of fiercest lightnings divine

There once was a blue-gray wolf
Whom destiny ordained warrior king of the world
Born to the saddle- blacksmith- tyrant to be
In the great valley of Gurvan Nuur
Storming with mane of flame and blood red
A forging of empire, the horder enthroned
Grim century of cruelty, of scourge and war
A man of his time- only more...

Rape and conquest
Cities to the sword
Atrocity massacre
Temujin




Vielfour fiery
Four corners race- stretch infinity
Cataclysms celebrate
A whirling soul ablaze with spirited gleam
A silence made sullen by the lightning's voice
Four armed comet scrapes a spiritless earth

Scream eternal void
Spinning firey cycles in uncorrupt space
The whimpering age of plead dissipates
Superseding failed flesh
Epochal sorrows unformed yet ripening
Smoke ebbing rays of their dying son

Slintering suns in the abyss
Wheeling Four evolve into Fifth
Dull clay and (matter) grey made ambient
Fourth season's funerary call to rebirth

Obeisant before blind eyes
Darkness and light untethered
Morality and law fall away
Save that which flows from the chariot of flame
Stigmata immeasurable
As if from the very heavens
And seas of carnage lap cruel and cold
Upon still shores

Solar Wills

From beyond the starry chasm
The stirrings of genocide unfurl
Commanding swine to the abattoir
Laying in wait for the rays of the sun
A silence made sullen by the lightning's voice
Four armed comet scrapes a spiritless earth


From beyond the multitude of stars
Arktos ouros- lotus petals unfurled
Portal to the vault of sun and lightning
Zeta Ursa Majoris- arms outstretched
Wheel to the chariot of the nightsky
Gammadion give us our strength- begotten

Through blood and flame
In iron embrace

The prophesied sign in the heavens
A balance of firebolts and solar virtues
The glyph of creation- father of all
The Phoenix purifies- ashes to the wind
Cleaves through the darkness of matter
Hail the death defiant- Vindex arise!

Begotten

Pregnant lightning shatters frozen joy
Foul frost creates from that which destroys
In iron embrace
Through blood and flame

Yet the memories endure
Of the final Avatara
Through the flames of the great end
Where lightning rains from the heavens
And glory wakes to walk proud
Through rites ripe with blood and faith
Upon inviolate mountain peaks
Where shines the rising sun

Begotten (through blood and flame)
In iron embrace
Begotten


Dash against the rocks the sickling and his cries
Break the back of the steed upon you ride
Boiling bodies of water, to glass the sand
And may mother's breasts shrivel and dust
Tongues shall be cut from gaping mouths
For I voice a culling course towards desolation
Yet those chained to their own foul flesh
Know only obsolescence- their nakedness

Push the rabble back, to the victor come the spoils
Work to certain death the labor that toils
Bloat and putrefy that which flowers
And tear from womb the bleating babe
The blind and wretched shall be left to rot
The diseased and alme dispatched
Give me your sick, your meek, your lowly
For I will kick the dogs when they are down

For I am the inferno
And you the kindling you the fuel
And I am the vulture
Feasting on your idols of flesh
I am the shepherd and you my flock
The lightning strike that splits the rock
For I am wrath- vindication
And the world my abattoir

Visions of war dreams of anger ectasy
A maelstorm of flame infernos of might
Lightning phallus crack of thunder roars
A lion in furious fight

Cleansing fire insatiable cleaving sword
The fall of the idols of flesh

The stellar winds beneath my wings
Are purest vengeance
The firestorms within my eyes
Black purest hate
Of blood unvanquished blasphemies
My will: one voice
With strike of tumult- aftermath
In withered flesh rejoice

For I am the inferno
And you the kindling you the fuel
And I am the vulture
Feasting on your idols of flesh
I am the shepherd and you my flock
The lightning strike that splits the rock
For I am wrath- vindication
And the world my abattoir

ANGEL CORPSE LYRICS




The dream pervades mysterious and lewd
I am One of Many offered unto thee
Bearing proud the brand of sacreligion
Sacrificed not in vain to Azazael
Cast down from the Heavens yet never Fallen
He - whom gods hath scorned
Eden's imbecile perimeter ruptured
I am of the Shining One

Whip merciless their flesh
Goad with firebrands
Trumpet the advent of the bloodspray
Enraptured by torment and flames
Broken on the rack crush the cult of Nazarene
My cup runneth over...
Each Nazarene I kill
Is one thorn more
In the crown of their false saviour
A king foresworn in a halo of flies

Prostrate disciples of derisive subjection
Their spirits exude deification of defeat
A talisman profane - vile birthright borne
Enslaving vigour as if nailed to a cross
Scoff at this inheritance of wretchedness
The Daimons erect shatter shackles of deceit
Sons of Vengeance consecrate burning ways
Wolves no longer in the guise of the weak



Gammadion upon our shields
The Conquerors draw nigh
Pentagrammaton - ashes to dust
Unbridled conflagrations purify

Christhammer

Swoon - poison souls procured
Acknowledge the rot of divinity

The dream pervades mysterious and lewd
I am One of Many offered unto thee
Bearing proud the brand of sacreligion
Sacrificed not in vain to Azazael
Cast aside despair in chaos consecrate
For visions become truth in wakefullness
The seeming sorrows that mark my face
With head held high are tears of joy



I am the spear in the wound of christ




Corvus corax descending
Through ashes smoke and pain
Stark sepia sigil of strength
The revealing stench of victory

Lycanthropic ripping death
A baptism in annihilation
Drips from the jaws and howls
An ultimate oblivion conceived

Wartorn...
A solution for flesh and bone
The morbid throne the strong revere

With genocide
Our might makes right
Where charnal houses
Leer at the world
Where crown and cudgel
Ferocity
Rains from the skies

Withered rotted bodies unburied
Lay piled in stacks instead
Vermin swarm and vultures gather
To feast upon the dead

Anthemic holocaust and hate
Stern lord of war and vengeance
Rough beast slouching eternal
Resolves the world to dust again



Wartorn...




Beasts of prey strike with lightning speed
Wagons of war collide
Metallic plague armored locusts drive
Into the storm of steel

Exterminate - feed the battlefield hunger
With honor that is loyalty unto death
Cauldrons swarming spearhead boiling over
The ironmonger's engines roar

Motorized slaughter panzers smash
Reliquary immemorial of runic conquest
Wincing crablike across a scarred land
Into the storm of steel

Bombs flagellate as poisoned rain
Corrosives soaking deep
The skin of earth erupts in sores
Wounds and filth unending
Winged death - spurting flames vilify
Splatter the Whore of Armageddon
Gutteral ejaculate - mummifying rust
Disintegrating bones to dust

Exterminate - feed the battlefield hunger
With honor that is loyalty unto death
Cauldrons swarming spearhead boiling over
The ironmonger's engines roar




Petals ripen glisten with yearning
Sanctified vessel inflamed
Fervent fingers twitch the gulf is closed
Envelop the pillar of alabaster
Cockroach entrenches in some awful orifice
Excavating living tissue
Barbaric caress - greased up and slick
pain scraping a backwards bending

Clamps smear open a warm paradise
Ribcage and vertebral column contracted tight
Bars stretched beneath the skin
Lips pulled back and drawn for curing
Penetrate - probing swollen infestation
Fisted into comprehension
Rigid so to bend contorted and suffer
Straight jacket of sadism

Phallelujah
Sanguinary rite of passage
Sweet tongues of fire
Phallelujah
Paroxims of union
Phallelujah

Judas tongue scrapes spit
Bites the hand that feed it
Infectious features baring cracked teeth
Bleeding gums of joy

Phallelujah...

Flaying souls breach the vestal wall
Chorus of angels consortium of pain
Enriched blood of freshly esoterica
Mingles with man in fluid form
Outpouring thrust pelvic abominations
Thick film of sweat grim lubrication
Soon to suckle maggots at her breasts
Celebrate the palsied throes of innocence

Phallelujah...




In the dancing blaze of world cremation
Ashes usurp the thrones of untruth
In the glowing funeral pyres
Where shadows and smoke no longer betray
Furnace fired - matter laid bare
The true nature of existence

Reap the whirlwind
Mercifully engulf the current universe
Reap...
Reap the whirlwind

Unfetter a seedling chaos to spawn
Strip away the artificial mantle
The veneer that pompously claims
That this world is worthy of salvation
Self satisfaction - armageddon
For that is all we can ask for



Every leader a fool with a facade
Every holy man a sinner
Every love a selfish lust
Every war an orgy of laughter
Every living creature a cancer
A defilement - this flesh corrupts

Reap...

All truth is fabrication
Almighty hallowed nothingness
All paths spiral downwards
All answers winged lies
All questions should be phrased with axes
Indulge celebrations enshrined in blood

Astride the inexorable
Jericho's wall shall crumble divine
Grasp the horns of the Dragons of Chaos
Furious we ride...






Lascivious - that which lies upon
A chimera of orgiastic buggery
Sodomite pedophile gaping welterd cunt
The tenderness of little girls is not unknwown to me
Ripping sacred vestments - venereal debauch
Frozen phalanx thrusts
Dampened walls summmon hallucinations
Erupting wicked cold that burns like fire

Daughters of joy await the vulgar visitation
Depravity nocturnal - emissive lusts they crave
Inject impurity filth and fornication
A winged satyr raping unsullied maids

A lewdness flailing enter clubbing whip
Bestial defloration serpent riding virgin whores
Their bloodied gates wide open for all to see
Into the realm (of the) despicable unborn

Urinary baptism and licked clean
Eat until it poisons me
Enslaved to those fleshly folds
Erected into bleakness

Unchaste phantasmagoria
The salacious sordid pulse prevails
Corrupting every orifice
Greedy for love

This flesh corrupt
On bestial bloodstained wings
Rites of disgust
The incubus obscene

Lascivious - that which lies upon
A chimera of orgiastic buggery
Sodomite pedophile gaping welterd cunt
The tenderness of little girls is not unknwown to me
A lewdness flailing enter clubbing whip
Bestial defloration serpent riding virgin whores
Their bloodied gates wide open for all to see
Into the realm (of the) despicable reborn




What is to be of this pestilience
That makes empires tumble like tears
The dust of millenia - fallen ages
Staunches the flow of dawning horizons
Obscuring -
While the days crumble as their hours unfold
A sensual swooning - prophetic mocking
As the soils swallow the seeds of the past

Each one of us to his own
Embrace
Drowning in hallowed solitude
Swallowing the void
The pallid hope revealed at last
Embrace

*Why should I fret in microcosmic bonds
That chafe the spirit and the mind repress
When through the clouds gleam beckoning beyonds
Whose shining vistas mock man's littleness?*
Throw off those shackles of sufferance
This penance of one thousand ordeals
I wield the scepter of destiny
Choose the means of my own death



Give me both nails and a hammer
Harness those ecstasies of death
Prostrate myself on cruciform
At last...

With swift feet I made my way
Helmed by a cacophony of despair
Deaf to the legacy of youthfullness
And beauty and joy since pined away
Yet now a rush falls upon my ears
Of dripping - whispering words
The hole of emptiness I pour through
Unveils the caress from far beyond

Now no longer can I ignore
What goes before has gone again
The silence of immorality
Satisfied with this one fell step
Plunge beneath the waters -
The freezing embrace of the goddess of death






Awake! Sons of Vengeance rise
Rub the dust of twenty centuries from your eyes
Fashion your being: ploughshares into weapons of war

Today we conquer the self - tomorrow the world

Men of war defiant - to ashes fall the gods
Apocalyptic deeds - fierce archonic might
A knell a pall masking honored rites of spring
The empyreal majesty of abyss winds

An affirmation of struggle
Like wolves closing in for the kill
Making holy our war immortal this glorious night
A brotherhood of iron - falling in we march
Shout into the star shattered Dawn...

We are Sons of Vengeance
Blessed and bold
Reborn in hate

Fingers of scorn fists of furious destruction
Discipline of steel beyond the roar of all war
Unleashed lightning storm brigades to be
Powerful creative joyous and free

ANGEL CORPSE LYRICS




Bearing at the edges of the world
The hallowed arms of those
Whom death hath struck down
Warriors from the beyond
In ranks both seen and unseen
Of this the desolation
Our enigmatic destiny

Consecration
Marching off to war
Iron blood and blasphemy
The unvanquished storm

The war bringer unyielding
Wield the greedy weapons
Girded for battle
Under victorious banner
Ever more total
Ever more occult
Breaking the deafening silence
My voice



Lightning hammer of gods
Uphold! Avenge! Arise!

Blessed and bold ascension
Like the firebearing star
Through thousands of ordeals
We are the sons of vengeance
Cast them down
Your cowardly impious eyes
Our gate alone evokes
A spell of destruction



Our storm our war!




Cut off your nose to spite your face
You cannot deny your natural desires
Sell the soul away parade into oblivion
Depravity transgress swallow the fear
Filth decay pollute the conscience
From violence was creation derived
Winds of change cannot awake paralyzed minds
Their choking utterances asphixiated

ENVENOMED
Envenomed

Mankind innate as one
Embracing the heart within himself
Machine of war dwells beneath the flesh
Enraged possessed by hell
Willing chaos self-destruction
The nihilist awakes to dawn
Entropic predatory force
Abort this putrid corpse



Copulate - decimate
Kings shall spawn from the soiled corpses
Crematory reign
Masturbate - desecrate
Seed of hate spilled forth
Absolute pain

Perversity cancerous devouring minds
The black miasma intrigues me
Nefarious lurid erotic deeds
Drown in malevolent dreaming
Rancid stench death foreboding
interrupts the futile thought of life
Curse eviscerate damnation
Rigor mortis silences any outburst




I am the warfare
Blasting in from blazing horizons
I am the abyssic lust
Tasting blood from the lips of the dying

Plague bearer
World shatterer

I am the reaper's blade
Writhe sadistic merciless
I am become death
Caressed by pallid fingers
I am the cruelty
That chaos doth evoke
Bearer of the black standard of war

When abyss winds return

Mountains smashed - crumble down
Bring to boil a sickly sea
Dance in the ashes of my enemies
10,000 years of victory

Plague bearer

World shatterer

I am the flames
That feast upon your fears
I am the lingering coals
Spawn of blessed cremation
I am the malignant goal
Hour funerary sacrifice
A Phoenix born of the Fallen Age
When abyss winds return




In the mouth of the wolf
I crush their execrations
Sweating out the poison
My skin crawls black with hate
Fall to fire
My vengeance burns across the sky
The scent of war and women
Black sullen thunder flames


Revenge
The taste is sweet
Their salted tears
The acrid smoke
The smell of burning death
Revenge
My joyous feast
I purge their souls
I stoke the flames
Inhale the burning death

Statuesque and impure
A cenotaph of treason
Avenge my fallen breath
A blood red crown my wrath
My throne eclipses the heavens

And storms above the stars
Iron judgement handed down
On wings of lightning death



Holocaust
Vengeance war
Skin crawls black with hate
Disaster
Angelcorpse
On wings of lightning death

Lord of the funeral pyre
Lord of my hate




The frozen has lain forlorn too many ages
Wasting away in the crucible of space
Drawing down the hallowed darkness
Arms outstretched embracing ecstacies of hate

Black solstice
Somber wings extinguish the sun
Nocturnal unfurling
Quenching stars one by one

Vomit war crush the sacred heart of kindness
Unholy raven spawned from dying dove of peace
Freezing the light expunge the furnace flames
Adoration of the prophetic release

My immolation the final comet
The hammer of damnation strikes
Pounding the earth my anvil
My life is to kill the light

Find solace in the fact that
Our pestis lays waste in both houses
Neither blind reverence or stark denial
Will alter the discipline of sterile beauty
That follows in the wake of the prophetic sign
And the deification of the strike of mailed fist
As cleansing chaos steals the light
The majestic darkness feeds

My life is to kill the light

The frozen has lain forlorn too many ages
Wasting away in the crucible of space
Drawing down the hallowed darkness
Arms outstretched embracing ecstacies of hate

Black solstice
Somber wings extinguish the sun
Nocturnal unfurling
Quenching stars one by one




I who wait and writhe and wrestle
With air that hath no boughs to nestle
My body weary of empty clasp
Strong as a lion and sharp as an asp
Give me the sign of the Open Eye
And the token erect of the thorny thigh
And the word of madness and mystery
Scapegoat

I am a man
Do as thou wilt as a great god can
I am awake
In the grip of the snake
The eagle slashes with beak and claw
The gods withdraw
The great beasts come
Scapegoat

Goat of thy flock I am gold I am god
Flesh to thy bone - flower to thy rod
Thrust the sword through the galling fetter

With hoofs of steel I race on the rocks
Through solstice stubborn to equinox
All-devourer - all-bequetter

And I rave
And I rape and I rip and I rend
Everlasting - world without end
Scapegoat






Firestorm within flesh
Carnivorous limpid eyes
Behind ecstatic lips
The crush of breath expires


Profanation - Violation
Hammering down war
Penetration - Suffocation
Lust infernal storm

Warhead weeping wound
Orgasmic thrust one hundredfold
Flagellate ripping spine
One thousand cuts explode



Lust infernal - soulflayer

Blood exhale from back drawn lips
Hammer bring down war
Cruelty sucking at my steel
Lust infernal storm

Torment fluids burn
Resurrect the suffering
Laid down torn apart
Soulflayer rises again






Born of sin and sacrifice
The tyrant seed of Germanicus
Destined for kingdoms of slaughter
Morbid revelations and incest
A viper lurking in the bosom of Rome
Wherefore forever stifles the light
He who is fallen

Witching swords and fratricide


Immortalized - perversion enthroned
Canonized - champion of ruin
Serpent obscene - walls bleeding black
Sadistic god - Caligula

Walls bleed black with intrigue
Beneath the throne of veneration
Cruelty's banner full eclipse

Success through suffocation
Where brothers kill their fathers
And murdered sons insist
That the fallacy of loyalty
Invokes a serpent's kiss



Execute
Praetorian master
Sacrificial lamb
Persecute - torment
Blood stained hands

Command the in name of Senate and the People
Let Saturnalian rites be raised
Uphold in desecrate mockery
The rigors of defamatory praise
Proud wives condemned to harlotry
To the fornication of barbarism
Wedded to the torture despicable acts
Lust deviance and sadism






Garden of earthly delights is mounting flames
We are burning our way to paradise

The lust for vengeance shall not despair
Blood and sperm - agony
War declared - now hear this

Sodomy curse

Fertile semen corrupted to vile seed
Obelisk of swollen beauty
Desperate ablution
Pollution



Disgrace wept bitter tears
Spit wipes away but what of the shame



Sodomy

ANGEL CORPSE LYRICS








Hopeless time Everything Falls Ideas Died One By One When the wounds are
crying And bats are drawn in blood They go to the moon The clouds come and
draw the smiles of the moon in the marsh of lilac Clouds reach from a
still silence of fog And we forget the night by it's dawn The Regret Of
Broken hearts You Trundle In Fucking Pain You couldn't see,you couldn't
feel Like a blinded fold You Bloody whore So shut up and die and Fuck Your
God.


Somewhere Near An Empty Space

Where The Inauspicious Fruit Fell To The Ground
Where The Birth Took Meaning
Where The Beginning Finished To The End
Nothing Began
The Look Of The Yellow leaves
Sleeping In Being Of Annihilation
A Sound Like My Notes
Silent Full Of Ambiguity
Glance Of A Child In Hot Desert
A Cold And Meaningless Calmness
The Voice Of The Hidden Graves
Clapper claw To Reach Death
The Secret Of Neatness And Whiteness Of Time 
The Abstruse And Sick Prism Of Being
Beauty The Abomination Of The Black Lines
The Regret Of The Innocent Walls
Being Under The Burning Flaws Without A Look Proceeding For Being
In a Deep And Human Look Castle,In Remembrance Of Humanity We Swear The Cunning
Adoration's For Existence _ Adoration's To Unfetter
The Battle Of Water And Fire_ The Battle Of Blood And Darkness
Again and again And At The End It Doesn't End Without Good And Bad
To Your Altitude I Fall,Annihilation
Open My Eyes To Your Sky But It Seems Nothing There Again
All Standing In a Deep Castle With Might And Assumption
The Black And Tired Hearts Hail Eternity
Endless Years,Eternal Darkness
A New Age,Age Of No Justice,The Age Of Darkness and Blood
The Age Of Cursed Life,and Empty Age 
As The Darkness Flies In The Sky The Angels Fall
Salvation Dies And Nothing Remains
The Day Of God Death Comes
A Joy Begins With Pain And Suffer
Praying To Anti Christ,Muhammad And Ibrahim
The Lie Dies And Truth Packs
Nothing Begins And Dumb Lands
Then We Bleed,Scream,Tear Ourselves And Experience The Brutality
At Least We Will Love The Darkness
In This Storm Of Blood And Darkness Under The Sand i Will Lay Without A Fire In being and a Whispers At Night.


In This Endless Hedge
Where Is The Way Of Salvation?
A Way To Run From Dirt
A way To Run From Oppression
The Last Hatch Of Light In Death Of Dark Eternity
Voided By Hands Of The Hunters Of Due
And No More I See Myself
There Is No One Left With A White Halo Around Him
But Mankind Grows Up In This Chaos And Palms The Life
Like The Worms Torsion Around Themselves
And Make Stairs By Their Corpses
To Keep On Living
But There Is No Return For This Way
And At Last They Will Make A Mountain Of Doubles Facing Them
A Black Mountain That In Top Of It's Peak They Palm The Light
And Heaven,Eternal World,Imaginary World Will Be A Reflection Of Lie
And Will Burn All The Truths
From That Moment God Died In That Paradise
Million Of Unknown Stars Shone
To Tow A Name Like Mankind
To Fierce Life
Were Looking For An Eternal World
Life Should Died In Stone Caves
It Should Ended To Nothing
And Who Am I?
One Of The Million Unknown Stars
My Thought Dry Like A Black

I Dont See The Truth A Dream
I Still Hunt The Blind Dots
And Put Off The Veil Of Mankind From My Face
I Am Deserved To Breath Oxygen
My Inner Thoughts Reveals A Black Future
And The Sun Which Wont Rise Tomorrow
Everything Will Remain In Silence
In A Cold Silence,In Peace
In Darkness,In Nothing
Like Being Born In Deep Vacuum
To Reach Nothing
To Myself,Me And Me
I Still Struggle With Myself
I Will Be Sacrificed For My Thoughts,knotted Thoughts
And Ask My Self?
Where Is The Way Of Freedom?
In A Deep Silence,The Stones Sing
Affection Was A Way For Hatred
In The Night When Salvation Hang
Honesty Was Crying
The Sun Knew That It Could Never rise
The Surging Rivers Stopped
The Clouds Cried,The Earth Devoured It's Self
Like Cosmos Was Dying
The Winds Were Howling
The Color Were Scattering
The red Tears Dropped
Suddenly I Was Facing Darkness
And He Introduced Himself Awareness,A Creature Beyond Good and Bad.
The Son Of Devil.
And Ten Pains Became Visible.


the troops of darkness fly high in the sky to a dark world where the blood
of the victims is running a spelled an unholy territory and you walk on
the graves of a thousand man from past to now. and you listen to dead
earth's screams fell the darkness, feel the hatred this is a truth from
inside of you this is a truth from within me oh, so dark and hateful so
mighty and able the repeating sentences, repeating poems it is not a
fucking dream this is the reveal of the despise and you feel it when you
are drawn when looking at night's sky and celebrating the birth of
humanity in the black holes of your being. who brings humanity to
perfection? my hands or your will? the silent shouts of the earth's
mothers? or the wondered philosopher of the recent century? or the wet
cheeks of the hungry children? or the feeble screams of the misanthropes?
or the tune of the old, fragile dying man? or this tiredness from the
cruelty of life? who brings humanity to perfection? the civilized material
worshiping man? it is the truth of mankind who lost the humanity and never
comprehended perfection there is never a meaning for human because
salvation is a meaningless phrase.


I Am Standing In A Bright Circle
I See An Of Reality
A Shadow From Existential Originality
Between Beyond And Truth
Among Protected Minds 

I Can Smell The Dirt 
The Black Lines Of My Mind Are Chained

I Hunt The Empty Spots
And walk Alone
Without Any Plans
Without Any Veils
I Go To No Where
To A Pure Insanity
Where The Evolution Alteration Is Apparent
I Leave Fear To The Dusk
I Merge In Myself
I Banish Myself
In A World Without Actors
I Witness The Crumble Barrier

I Can Smell The Dirt 
The Black Lines Of My Mind Are Chained

A Midst The Arms Of Gods
The Menial Gods 
In Face With Sin
Falling Wait For Me
But I'm Still Standing
In The Bosom Of The Darkness Insanity
Among The Existential Truth Of Mine
In A Battle A Midst The Sick Minds 
I Have Nothing To Show The Beauty
Answer Are Among The Shadows
I'm Standing In a Bright Circle
Between Beyond And Truth
Among Protected Minds
Maybe Should Go Back Wards


the cursed nights remember me when the madness of ripping rooted in me the
cursed nights remember me when the branches of hatred surrounded my throat
the cursed nights remember me when the shadow were disgusted of themselves
the cursed nights remember me when the color of white was broken when
lights were dead lights were dead in the lagoons of darkness they were
dying and the scars were crying all were repeating in the isolation of
truth the dirty passages of humanity were destroying and I trundle in my
blood in the midst of the dirts of humanity I rip my body where is hope?
what is beautiful? when everything is stained everything falls when the
human-like pigs butcher everything was dark from the beginning everything
was misfortune and the cursed nights remember me when everything will be
forgotten

ANGANTYR LYRICS


Et varsel om dod,
Til kyst bliver drevet af fygende storm
Traden knaekkes af klippe og hav
En thul til stranden gar for tommer at samle
Et varsel om dod, baret af blaest

Sejl I revfyldte vande flaenses pa langs
Bolgeganger brydes
Ofret bliver fae for AEgir at mildne
Greip tager fat

Stemmer af raedsel og frygt for Ran
Forsvinder i stormen
Skaebner til havs forgar
Thul pa strand nu ser fredfyldt til da boven brydes
En kriger fra havet skal komme

Bolgeslag omkringvender skibet
Arngrim kastes til havs
Verdandes trad flosses
Men liv bliver holdt ved lige af tanke
Pa slaegtens stolthed og haevn

Sonderslagen krop pa strand opskylles
Landet maerker Arngrims komme
Ved thulens ord han vagner
"Du er ventet"


I en drom for laenge siden sa jeg en fremtid
Et skib skulle kaentre, en kriger kom fra havet

I landet hersker ufred blandt maend
Glemt har de fordums pragt
Til korset er mange vendt
Men skjult er folk af skoven
Der ej har glemt den gamle saed

Tager du ved fuldmane de glemte stier
Med stolthed i hjerted og fortid i hu
Lytter du til skovens stemme
Med abent sind

Vil du finde vejen gennem tagernes land
Folket i det glemte torster efter haevn
De vil lede dig pa vej

Men lad dit navn vaere ukendt
Til den nat du betraeder tagernes dal
Da skal din slaegt fa oprejsning
Og det gamle folks haevntorst vil slukkes


Vind slar om i nord, frostkold sol star op
I skovbryn et baghold laegges, stimand fanges skal
Rygter om kaettersk opstand er naet byens orer
Lysets logn skal styrkes med mandebal bytorv

Stimand naermer sig skoven med lang natfaerd bag sig
AEnser ej den ventende fjende
De gamle stier han soger, den glemte vejs ende
Begyndes skal den sidste krig
Og magtgale folk bringes i knae

Vislen af pile omkring stimanden hores
Kniven traekkes og skjul bliver taget
Fem maend i byens dragt med svaerd og buer
Naermer sig i stilhed
Til kamp gor manden klar, ojner ingen flugt
Klarer sa sit sind og lytter gennem disen
Stemmer pa et aeldet sprog hvisker ud af tagen
Galder over stal

De forste to gar til angreb, svaerd er kniv overlegent
Hug saettes in mod skulder og ben
Men stalet maerkes ej

Fingerstrog af rim, berort har stalet
Evne til skade at forvolde, disen har stjalet
Betvingeren af stal undslipper balet

Fem folk pa flugt, usarlighedens ham de frygter
Af blind overtro smittet, om djaevelskab fortaelles
En fylking skal samles, marchere under kors
Frygten for opstand de vil sla ned
Med eventyr om guddom


Med syn for sag han gar til skovs, saret blev han ej
Klinger fem af stal gav hug, kraft i jern berovet var

Ventede ej at tagen blev en fraende
Vidste ej en sadan ting kunne haende
Thulens ord fik ny betydning
Det gamle folk ej levende var

En kraft han maerker ved elvens bred
Stammer ni star i kreds blandte hoje
Traeer taette vokser til for hans blik
I midten star han nu fanget

Ventede ej at skoven blev en fjende
Vidste ej en sadan ting kunne haende
Med tanke pa sin aet han traekker stal

Tage vaelder frem af hoj, skygger bryder ud af trae
Stammer ni nu star som skygger
Det gamle sprog nar atter oren

"Dalens sti fandt dine ojne, du kom fra fremmed havn
Glemmes skal lysets logne, vandrer sig os dit navn"

Sit navn han gav til tagens folk og svor en ed i blod
Smed knivens blad i skovens muld
Og trak op et svaerd

Ventede ej at tagen blev en fraende
Vidste ej en sadan ting kunne haende
Thulens ord fik ny betydning
Det gamle folk var nu hans aet


Kaldt til tinge alle daner
Stormaend fra nord rider ind
Gar til sals under praegtige faner
Hovisk tale filder alles sind

Fredfyldt gar forhandling om jord og titler
Familiers sar bliver laegt, og stride glemt
Alliancer bliver smedet og aeresord bliver givet
Mjod i mange mal forsegler denne dag

Manen bryder frem ved ulvehyl
Skyggerne af mange krigere falder pa langild
Tingsal bliver besat af griske folk og stal fores til nid

Danermordet-Kujonens hand skaelver
Danermordet-En uvaerdig dad

De fleste slogs til jorden
Endnu for de vaben trak
Son og kvinde kom til hjaelp forgaeves
Viste nidfolk stedet hvor resten var

Doren sparket ned til barneskrig
Habene blev knust som hovedskaller sma
Kvinderne trak vaben men evnerne var fa
Snart la lig i dynger og sal i flammer stod

Ud af flammer en skikkelse lob
Forbraendt og saret
Flygtede fra mordsal med liv i bug
Haevnen havde hun i hu


Fortabt og alene flygter hun gennem fyr
AEtten hendes myrdet blev
Af nidfolk der ryggen har vendt
Til den gamle tro pa det gamle folk

Maerke kan hun, at barnet snart til verden vil komme
Skjul hun bygger ved brusende elv
Gor sig klar til fodsel i smerte
Beslutsom hun svaerger en ed

"Ved alverdens ukendte kraefter
Skal jeg bringe liv til dette barn
Berette ham om aettens aere
Sa han en dag kan disse mord haevne"

Fodselsskrig nu hores fra bade kvinde og spaed
Skovbarn I elv bliver viet til fortids saed
Stov fra skovbunds samles
En skygge traeder frem
En stemme skabt af vinden
Blaeser gennem lov
Forfaerder kvindens oren

"Gamle tiders aet fodes nu pa ny
Barnets liv har du til skoven viet
I bytte vi bringer dig krigeren fra havet
Sammen skal i samle en haer af trofast folk"

Grådkvalt hun giver bort sit barn


Forbund er blevet dannet
Krigeren fra havet og skovbarnets moder
Sammen de gar fra gard til gard
Trofast folk soger
Haevnens ild braender i dem begge

Snigmord pa Danernes ledere
Nid mod folkets aet
Forraederi og hunger efter guld
Blod for blod og Liv for liv
Gammel gaeld skal betales
Sydpa tager de af sted

Vejbidt lille gard mellem skov og strand
Besoges nu af oprorets folk
Ved balet sidder thulens og venter
Stegeben og mjod bydes Arngrims maend
Og syddeplads tildeles
Thulens raekker Sigyn en stav af bog
Og vinden stilner af

Runer er ristet i staven
Fortaeller om den gamle saed
Og det nye kapitel
I historien om tagens folk

Alliancerne er mange hos folket fra nord
Alle er de sammenbundne af sogen efter haevn

Et smykke gives til Arngrim
Symbolet pa krig
Lad dette vaere navnet
Pa svaerd du trak af skov

Alliancerne er mange hos folket fra nord
Alle er de sammenbundne af sogen efter haevn

Tiden er nu kommet for blod at spilde
For liv at ende, for nidgaeld at betale
Tågens folk skal lede vores vej

ANGANTYR LYRICS





Vi er stormen fra nord, raser over land
Blodet fryser til is i dine årer
Alt håb du ejer visner bort, alt håb om liv for dig blegner...
Fæst ej dit blik på os
Mareridt og frygtindgydende billeder
Er alt du får at se
Af krige forlængst vundet, og nedslagtede fjender
Fior sandhedens time er kommet
Og kun ham med rent hjerte og klart syn vil bestå
Så sku mod horisonten og vær vidne til din egen undergang
Du underskrev din egen dødsdom
Da du knælede og modtog velsignelse fra løgneren i kjolen.


Danens rige Danens liv
Alt blev taget fra os
For hver af vore frænders død
Skal dræbes ti af jer
Kom så, landsmænd!
Grib jeres våben, landeplagen skal borg.
Ingen nåde viser vi jer usle krub
Forblændet fra barnsben til evig underkastelse
I tror blindt på korsets ord
Fortæller selv løgnene videre
Kraven er blot et tegn på løkken om jeres hals
Jeres svig mod Danmark går ikke ustraffet hen
I hænges i træerne langs landevejen
Så alle kan se jeres rådnende lig.





Med våben i hånd trænger vi ind i løgnens hus
Bygget på vor landsmænds lig
Slår din kjoleklædte krop til blods
Og vælter dig af højsædet
Dine blinde efterfølgere jamrer hjælpeløst over dit fald.
En ny ære er begyndt
Rejser sig mægtigt fra tusind års støv

I der knæler i ynk
Skal slås voldsomt tilbage
I der knæler i ynk
I lever på talte dage
Omvæltningen er på vej, ofrene blir mange
Kristent blod vil atter flyde

Nu vil du ikke blive skånet
For sandhedens time er kommet


Frostvind blæste og vinter stod høj
Da den mørke hær samledes
I dyb skov vi planlagde
Sejren over lysets udvalgte

De kom fra nord, som brændingen ved flod
Og svøbte i mørke, tagen over land

De vrimlede gennem skov og sne
Og mørklagde byer, overalt brændte lysets fæstninger.
De af lysets hær der ikke døde
Prøvede at flygte i ly af natten

De blev brændt af faklerne, vi bar med os på natfærd.
Den nat..

Dengang frostvind blæste sejrede vi over lyset
Men kampen er endnu ikke forbi...

ANGANTYR LYRICS




Beyond desertic fields of ice
Monstrous winds claim for their homeland
Defied, everything that stands still
Is hit by the cold in their hearts
Sung is this desolating
Victory, by the dead trees and the
Troubling choirs of tortured wind
Enchanting melodies of the Dark

Beyond the magnanimity
Of white snow's claimed purple gardens
One grand crystal palace was built
Symbol of the ruling of death
Hidden in a crystalline room
Stands the only living flower
Trapped in a magic box of the
Only ice beholder of a spark

Lost once more, I don't know where to go
Lost the sacred memory
I forgot, where am I from?
One broken branch from the grapevine

Lost my only heart's bed
No where can he rest all peacefully laid
Another lost wanderer was born
How could I lose myself so easily?

Behold the magic
From Gaia's darkest child's
Relentless lips
Kissing all your sins

Seduced, I finally
Stood still against the wind
My heart was not cold
My heart was no more

In the realm of Forever-Night,
My one and, one and only, my only heart is lost

The only thing for me to do is to
Free the last flower from its wicked prison
It has the power to unveil the truth and the honor
But this Forever-Night will last until Aeon's dawn

Beyond snow's invaded lands
An infant hides and stares at the sky
Covered by the dying clouds
Of greyness and of emptiness
Beyond the Forever-Night
An infant deprived from her heart
Gets up and begins his last walk
She's heading for the crystal palace

...where her last hope still lives


Just a walk, the one, one last hope stands
Forgetting all the rules, refusing to conform
I'm a prey in the grey
Oh why should I obey?
You're lost, in the deep disarray
One last try to one day scream victory... VICTORY!

One more lost soul
Now left with no colors
A dead flower
Who never saw summer

Where art thou hidden colors?
Thou mystic shades of life
Can a dream still breathe
after dying so many times?

Nothing left to give
All yet to be born
Dying rules from Earth
For the rise of my dreams

Seeking the Moonlight
Teachings from the sea
Listen to thy heart
And claim thy glory, and sing this song

One fantastic Quest for a new paradise

One day, no more I could give
To this world, like an empty bottle
Tearing my heart for this song
Is just not a routine

One day, no more I could feel
For this world, when the last hope shall die
The final countdown has begun
But how long will it last?

For the love and for the passion beyond the skin
For the burning desire to unveil the mystery

From all the pain left with only a stain
Could only be cleaned by the truest lover's kiss

One last dream to share
One more soul to harvest
One more try to
One day scream victory

Breathing honesty
Bring me close to thee
Dying rules from Earth
For the rise of my dreams




I am not from a gutter
Even though it feels like it
I do not wish to murder
So why should I sing about it?

Dragons no more ride their wings
And I'm not the one lie
Satellite-illusions of stars shining
Makes me want to cry

What's the true meaning of Pleasures and Satisfaction?
What's the true feeling of total liberation?
Is a body deserted when it feels no more pain?
Is the heart useless when it no more longs to cry?

Oh can the garden of purple gloom totally be conquered?
Or will there forever be a flower somewhere living even if in ice?


I still forever remember
the first time I heard
delightful sounds of hope
and the fire burning the rope

I could not hide my tears away
from this divine beauty
it feels like I had never
lost my heart at all


Waves of passionate tenderness
Angel of all angels lending me her shoulder
Mystical garden growing in the Dark

I still forever remember
the feeling I had
of a new world revealing
and its dawning dream

I discovered
a very long lost child
who opened his eyes
and was inspired by the Moonlight


Waves of passionate tenderness
Angel of all angels lending me her shoulder
Mystical garden growing in the Dark




Take my hand
I will never let you fall again
Lay your head on my breast
I need you to feel my beating heart

Closely… in you…

So many tears were shed
Like rivers who cannot find rain
So many frozen dreams
Broken by the tortured wind

But all this time it was there
The misty sounds of the deep sea
And now by the snow its melody echoes… oh oh
Making its way to my ears

Never will a snow flake
Lay again in purple gardens
Never will one living wonder
Be all alone again

Beyond this Forever-Night
The dead grey fades away
Beyond the night’s crisped sky
The Moonlight gently smiles

Closely… in me…

Take my hand
I will never let you fall again
Lay your head on my breast
I need you to feel my beating heart…

Closely into your frail body

So many mysteries
Lies in the sea’s Cruel Beauties
So many living wonders
Sing their dreams to others

Never will I doubt again
The return of the rain
Never will I feel again
The fear of the Crystal pain

Beyond her motherly hands
Is where all the beauty stands
Beyond her comforting breast
My heart found a place to rest


Oh what a night
Dancing with the romantic breeze of spring
Feels like I could fly with my wings
My new purple wings

Oh what a site
Dandelions play with me in the park
Feels like my eyes now hold a spark
A new mystic spark

Sing once again with me the melancholy
And all the things we cannot see
Sing once again with me just a piece of truth and then well see
Just how seldom is our wisdom

Oh what a smile
A child has when his daddy comes back from work
The child doesn't see hes gone berserk
There's too much work

Oh what a scream
A child makes when some monsters shakes its bed
Their teeth are brown, their eyes are red
And I think it sounds fun

Sing once again with me the melancholy
And all the things we cannot see
Sing once again with me just a piece of truth and then well see
Just how seldom is our wisdom

The romantic breeze inspires rainbow twirling petals
To dance with me where the Moonlight shines

Oh what a spell
Changes city parks into magic realms?
Lets not say who is the lovely witch
Behind all of this

Sing once again with me the melancholy
And all the things we cannot see
Sing once again with me just a piece of truth and then well see
Just how seldom is our wisdom


Alright, tonight we will climb to the sky
We will ride the stars tonight

I flee
And you fly
We fly
Tonight
In the sky

Tonight
We'll ride the stars
So far
Waiting
Midnight to ring

A lullaby for this wonderful night, climbing the stars
A melody that makes the big monsters sleepy

Flying
In new born spring
We sing
The hymn
Of new born stars

A melody playing with the feeling
Of when Midnight Rings

A magic kingdom
Unveils to my wide eyes
Revealing to me
How to ride the stars

Just hold on tight and
Don't close your eyes
You will soon see the Moonlight
Night's only ray of light




Stepped into a beginning tale
Where it is Forever the Night
Maybe I will live enough to tell
A story from so far so close to the heart

Rainbow petals twirling in the night
A garden growing in the dark
Responding choirs from the stars
Magical voices heard about everywhere

Hiding so softly, just for a moment
Safely away, all alone to play

Stepped into an enchanting tale
Where the wind blows into its flute
Where trees play harp so magically
Into the woods of Forgotten-Lands

A small tribe stands around a fire
Accompanying the melody
Accompanied by an unknown voice
With strange instruments from another time and place

Hiding so softly, just for a moment
Safely away, all alone to play
Far away, around the fire
Tribal Dreams, humble fantasies


Suddenly,
The Moonlight shines to me
It reaches me, into my humble bedroom
Suddenly,
I feel that I could flee

Magically,
It seems that I can see
All the eyes, from forests that never dies
Suddenly,
The tears fall into me

Through the trees, on the ground
Lies the light sought for so long
Through the branches and the caves
Sings a voice with unknown words

Suddenly,
Seems a voice into me
Sings to me, in unspoken tongues
Magically,
Her words I can now see

Telling me,
Soon you will see the sea
Fly the sky, and ride the stars
Telling me,
She is Eternity

Suddenly,
She opened all my ears
And I heard such wonders

I have heard,
Enchanting melodies
From the roses and from the thunder
This is all,
That I can make of it
This is all that I can make of it


An infant stares at the sky
Covered by the Starlights
Amazement fills his sparkly eyes

An infant learns to smile again
Covered by the gentle Moonlight
All of his sorrows were not in vain
...feeling so safely naked

Finally the clouds are exploding
Down down the rain is pouring
Hearing new colored birds sing
And fantasies breathing

Landed in a dream of deep enchantments
Overwhelmed by new warmth into my chest
Feelings of pleasure running into my body
I open my eyes and forever let go

An infant bathes in the light
Covered by Moon's serenity
Feeling that with his wings, to fly, he might
...a universe where...

Wilderness is full of wisdom
And where the wisdom is wild
Where Angels are better seductress
Then Gaia's darker child's

...now that my garden richly grows
Why would I need to harvest autumn's flowers...

Still you look like you don't understand

This is your great chance to
An opportunity to
A brand new start for you to
A clean late for all your friends too

Bring ye forth the free markets
In which you'll give us free labour
Behold the modern, free slavery

Freedom has now struck you
Join us now or fuck you
Freedom now demands you
Freedom wants a thank you

Spoken like a true emperor
Spoken like a true conqueror
Spoken like a true terrorist


Ripping through the darkness
Rays from spotlights drawing lines
Sending out a message
From which nobody can hide
Searching for a weakness
Or ignorance of any kind
Capital neon letters
Casting shadows in my mind

Prompting for attention
Making me feel sick
Insulting my intelligence
With every cheapish trick
What they're really after
Is as clear as the signs
The message isn't subtle
Between those neon lines

Lies 'r' us
We make up everything we're selling
In fear we trust
With it comes need and hypochondria
We rip the crust
Tear it off, and let new blood flow like
Tears from lush
And we squeeze, and we're laughing at you

Standing at the crossroads
The grave torment of choice
My silhuette defining
Against the background noise
Contemplating weapon
Sarcasm, irony or dis
Leaning towards candor
And sober analysis

Hello Hello Moto
I'm not sure I'm lovin' it
Santa's favourite soda
Will make you just as fit
And am I really worth it
Am I having it my way
I figure I'll just do it
I'll think different - as you say

Lies 'r' us...


Suits - shirts with matching ties
Dull by choice but watch the eyes
Sharp - and just like our shoes they shine
Despite the darkness there behind

We walk the finance district
Concrete, glass and steel
Corridors and airplanes, an all effective shield
From ordinary people left out of the deal
But most important keeps us
From how we really feel

Keep underestimating us, we don't care
The last laugh's ours
The joke's on you down there
Keep underestimating us, hide in your hair
Just stay unaware

Deal - in our world means steal
Trust - fund is the first thing that comes to mind
Right - politically correct
Loyal - the puppets we elect

"Structurally reforming","modernising states"
A "democratic process", with no open debate
We come up with phrases and names for everything
Just to keep you guessing, we don't call it what it is

Keep underestimating us, we don't care
The last laugh's ours
The joke's on you down there
Keep underestimating us, hide in your hair
Just stay

Robin Hood has since long gone away
No one that good in this egocentric day
Day and night, we're speeding past the signs
Yes traffic lights are just recommendations for our kind

Some have learned to put together two and two
And then they turn against us, nothing new
Naomi Klein, who shocked you into buying
"The confessions of an economic hitman" lies

Real - estate, we own the lot
Love - you bet it can be bought
Growth - in the third world we just put a straw
And yeah that's right - we suck

Imaginary freedom keeps the cattle calm
Space enough to turn 'round
And a fair amount of halm
Well soon it's time for slaughter
We're lining up the PIGS
The smallest are for starters, salut, bon appétit!

Keep...


We had a place by the ocean
We lived by it's rules
And our housee seemed to hover
Over the tide
Until that Boxing Day morning
When all slates were wiped clean
And though the wave evanescent
The change permanent

And while we were looking for loved ones
They sealed off the beach
We were told we would not be safe there
And the barricade grew
As a provisional precaution
We were moved off the island
No return tickets given
We still gaze at our home from the town

They've cleared the rubble
And with it everything else
Strong foundations set for the five star hotels
No wave can compare
This compels us to die

It is survival of the richest
With enormous appetite
It steals, it robs, it takes, it snitches
Like there's no tomorrow
It is unnatural selection
The lucky and the dead
The fever spreads like an infection
A cancer on the earth

It won't ever be the same
To them this is just a game
But it will never be the same

They say this camp's temporary
But what will come next
They lay down pipes for our sewers
But didn't drill any wells
And the streets of Male's still flooded
And we are but drops
In an ocean of people
With nowhere to go

It is survival of the richest...

It won't ever be the same
A tsunami will rise again
It will never be the same
A tsunami will rise again


They could be anywhere
You're nor safe even in your TV-chair
It could come through the air
Land or sea - the terror's everywhere

They could be anywhere
You're not safe, not even under there
It could come through the air
In your mail - the terror's everywhere

It could be anyone
Could be your neighbour, could be your only son
Don't hesitate to inform
Pick up the phone, the witch-hunt is on

Now plant the seeds of hate
A distorted mirrorworld
False flag deception - manufacturing consent
Let's point the finger
Trust the mistrust
Give the speech of
Peace and freedom
Peace and freedom
Peace and freedom - for all

Well we've come to the show
Burning towers crumble into dust
Acting like we don't know
When deep inside every thinking human must
Jetliners vaporize
Passports, bandanas and bodies still intact
No fighters patrol the skies
For two full hours - undeniable fact

Now reap the fields of hate
And send us off to war
False flag deception - manufacturing consent
It's neverending
Blood and money
Just keep spending
Peace and freedom
Peace and freedom
Peace and freedom - for all


"Virtually all of the concrete of these enormous 
structures was pulverized into very fine dust.
Try this: get a piece of concrete and drop it,
a little over a thousand feet, and see if it pulverizes
into very fine dust.
It won't happen."

Inconceivable
Unbelievable

Can you smell the Reichtag fire in the air
The Mainila, the Mukden, the Gleiwitz of today
Serving casus belli - poisoned delicacy
Pearl Harbour, JFK, RFK
Admitting to Gulf of Tonkin and
Operation Northwoods
In another 40 years: 7/7 and Madrid
Through media playing mind games
All built on FEAR
False - Evenets - Appearing - Real
False - Evenets - Appearing - Real


"Your majesties, your royal highnesses,
distinguished members of the
Norwegian Nobel committee.
We are at war.
War.
War, war, wars, wars, wars, wars and wars,
war, and armed conflict.
Battle in a distant land.
Wars, wars and nuclear war.
Holy war.
War in one form or another.
Just war.
We choose to wage war.
Just war, war, war.
Total wars.
Another world war.
The relationship between war and peace,
and our effort to replace one with the other.
The destructive power of war.
I understand why war is not popular,
but I also know this: the belief that peace is
desireable is rarely enough to achieve it.
We will not eradicate violent conflict in our lifetimes.
Ther will be times when nations, acting
individually or in concert, will find the use
of force not only necessary, but morally justified.
The waging of war.
The prospect of war.
The conduct of war.
So yes, the instruments of war do have a role to
play in preserving the peace.
War is sometimes necessary.
Let me make one final point about the use of force.
Yes there will be engagement,
yes there will be diplomacy, but there must be
consequences - when those things fail.
We choose to wage war.
Thank you very much."

Now sing the song of hate
Or forever hold your peace
False flag deception - manufacturing consent
With or against
There's no exceptions
No excuse
Just peace and freedom
Peace and freedom
Peace and freedom - for all

False - Events - Appearing - Real
False - Events - Appearing - Real



Behind the ostenible goverment
sits enthroned an invisible government,
owing no allegiance and acknowledging
no responsibility to the people


We have heard that half a million
children have died
I mean that's more children
than died in Hiroshima
You know, is the price worth it?


I think this is a very hard choice,
but the price, we think the price is worth it

Chosen by God
And the world has to answer to us
We'll show who we are
If you can not believe it
We are chosen by God
You are with or against us
There is no in between


Our enemies are innovative
and resourceful - and so are we
They never stop thinking about new ways
to harm our country and our people
- and neither do we


The biggest threat to America today is not
communism, it's moving America
toward a fascist theocracy.
And everything that's happened during the
Reagan administration is stearing
us right down that pipe.


...you said: 'the people that were elected
last week'. They have not been elected.
That is the point that I'm making, and in the
case of Baroness Ashton: she has never been
elected to public office in her entire life.
She takes an enormously powerful job,
and the peoples of Europe, of Britain,
of everywhere else - do not have the power
to hold her to account and to remove her.
And that fundamentally is what is wrong with
this whole European Union, It's all about
bureaucracy versus democracy. Things have
gone horribly, horribly wrong.

Chosen by God
And the world has to answer to us
We'll show who we are
When you least will expect it
We are chosen by God
You are with or against us
There is no no


Recited and translated

Chosen by God
And the world has to answer to us
We'll show who we are
And you better believe it
We are chosen by God
You are with or against us
There is no alternative


In your asylum
Guarded by fire
A castle of ice resides
Bordered by wire
In perfect silence
Hovering
The shape of your body
That I know you're in

I look into those eyes
See nothing but despise
In your eyes
As love turns to hate
Love turns to hate

In your asylum
Behind those walls
The night sky is endless
But there are no stars
They have all fallen
You've made your last wish
And you try not to think of the fact
That I still exist

And you pretend you cannot hear
This monologue my dear
As you hide
As love turns to hate
Love turns to hate

And everytime that I try
You turn your back, turn your back on me
And every way that I ride
The tangle and thorns awaiting me
A wall of roses
That exposes no entrance for me
You seem to be complete
Without me

In your asylum
Inside your shell
A pearl slowly forming
But noone can tell
If in the darkness
It sparkles and shines
And there's no way of knowing
If it's all lies

I can't explain but there's something
Unnatural in the way
That you cry
As love turns to hate
Love turns to hate


Preemptive attack as a matter of fact
Let no one escape, leave nothing intact
Eye for the eye they might try to scratch
They won't stand a chance
There'll be no rematch

Just keep on going, drive over them
I saw a boy throw a stone, I think
Drive over them
Rip apart the walls
Blast away all running civilians
Then try to cover it up, but it can't be done

'Cause everything is painted in red
Yeah - starting to show
All the things you don't want us to know
Talking head
Yeah - shaking us so
As all we can do is play dead

Still, lie still
And try not to breathe

Scorched the earth, the scars run deep
An infected tattoo, an oasis of blood
Do you expect us to look the other way
When nothing is more obvious

And everything is painted in red
Yeah - starting to show
All the things you don't want us to know
Talking head
Yeah - shaking us so
As all we can do is play


... there, one o'clock.
Haven't seen anything since then.
Just fuckin', once you get on 'em just open up.
All right, firing.
Let me know when you've got them.
Let's shoot.
Light them all up.
Keep shootin'.
Keep shootin'.
Roger.
Got 'em.
Oh. sorry what was going on?
God damn it, Kyle.
All right, haha, I hit 'em.
Got a bunch of bodies layin' there.
Oh yeah, look at those dead bastards.
All right, we got about uh eight individuals.
There's one guy moving down there but he's uh,
he's wounded.
Come on buddy.
All you gotta do is pick up a weapon.
Come on, let us shoot!
Come on.
Clear.
Clear.
Nice.
Nice.
Good shootin'.
Thank you.

Silence - nothing but silence here
Tears fertilizing the sand
Still nothing is growing
Silence
And we sleep under stars with the roar
Still fresh in our memory
Remembering a time
When everything was fine


There was approximately four to five individuals
in the vehicle moving bodies.
Looks like a kid. Over.
I got a wounded girl, we need to take
her to Rustamiyah.
Could you tell the battalion that two civilian
children casualities are coming back to
Rustamiyah in the Bradley. Over.
I've got uh eleven Iraqi KIA's, one small child
wounded. Over.
Roger. Ah damn.
Well.
Oh well.
Well it's their fault for bringing their
kids to a battle.

Strike them hard, backstabbing allie
Weaken and starve them
With unreasonable sanctions
Then try to sell that with limited resources
They've developed new weapons
Of mass destruction

Trojan horse of Kuwait worked out well
Sent Glaspie to smile and Nayirah to cry
Do you expect us to look the other way
No nothing is more obvious

Yes everything is painted in red
Yeah - starting to show
All the things you don't want us to know
Talking head
Yeah - shaking us so
As all we can do is play dead


I think he just drove over a body.
Did he?
Yeah.
Maybe it was a visual illusion, but it looked like it.
Well they're dead, so.
We're shootin' some more.
Hey, you shoot, I'll talk.
Engaging with Hellfire.
You're clear.
All right firing.
We're not even going to watch this fuckin' shit?
Target it.
And firing.
There it goes, look at that bitch go!
Paloosh!
Roger. Building destroyed. Engaged with three
Hellfire missiles.
Nice missile.
Did it look good?
Sweet.


Thought I was supposed to ask
When I could not understand
I didn't know some questions
Were frowned upon or banned
So when I first saw the shadow
I trembled and I shook
I grabbed your hand and pointed
But you didn't even look

My son you see shadows
Embarrasement and shame
But the sun makes the shadows
The trees are not to blame

I recall the sunshine
And the look in your eyes
As we reached for the sky
In another time

But at night in the dark
I just couldn't see
Couldn't see
And the pain and the fear
Came haunting me
Haunting me

There's something under my bed, oh
Don't tell me it's all in my head, no
I can't make it out in the darkness
But the contours look like a monster
Daddy why can't you stand upright
Mommy why do you just cry

Go back to sleep
Go back to sleep

So I never asked again
But I didn't understand
What was the point to have me
If they couldn't find the time
So I swallowed the shadow
And made it part of me
I thought that'd make them happy
But that was not to be

My son you're a shadow
Embarrasment and shame
Our son is in shadow
You're standing in the way

I recall the sunshine
And the look in your eyes
As we reached for the sky
In another time

But at night in the dark
I couldn't see
Just couldn't see
And the pain and the fear
Came haunting me
Haunting me

There's something under my bed, oh
Don't tell me it's all in my head, no
I can't make it out in the darkness
But the contours look like a monster
Daddy why do you stare through me
Mommy why do you just cry

Go back to sleep
Go back to sleep


The needle points at you and me
Shining in the light
But I can see a trace of blood
On the good doctor's hand
Epileptic seizure
For no apparent reason
Anaphylactic shock
You think they're gonna cover this one up

Stuffed up on the media altar
The beast still lokks alive
All hail the New World Order
All bow in fear and awe

And their eyes cannot see
And their ears do not hear
And they say it cannot be
Is there something wrong with me

The Galileos of today
Freak accidents and suicides
The scientific community
Is now hijacked and used for greed
Astra Zeneca, Glaxo Smith Kline
A simplified spelling needed
And it would read Frankenstein
Isn't that Witty

Take up the Rich Man's burden
The savage wars of peace
Now fill the mouth with venom
And bid the sickness cease

And their eyes cannot see
And their ears do not hear
And they say it cannot be
Is there something wrong

And even if those pulling the trigger
All but openly admit
Their anonymous committee advisors
All stand to profit

And even if you could turn some heads 'round
To see the smoking gun
Cannot do anything about it
It cannot be undone

Cannot drain the veins of our children
In hope the poison spout
Cannot slap the cheek of autism
And ask it to snap out

And their eyes cannot see
And their ears do not hear
And they say it cannot be
Is there something wrong with me

ANDROMEDA LYRICS


Deep in the soil
Trembling silence
Stones in the making
Tension release
Digging a hole
Blood sweat and tears
No rest and no sleep
Then - I found a key

Teeth shimmering silvery grin
Mocking yet serene
Gethsename staring indifferent
Stunning beauty in green
At once obsessed
Obedient without parole
Substract, withdraw
A piece of the soul

Deeper and deeper
Searching for years for
Something to open
I could not see
My science for god
My modus operandi
Of understanding
Stood in the way

This is the turning point
The moment of truth
Consider every piece of knowledge
Gathered during this pursuit
Confined, locked in
Convinced there has to be more
Browsing through all the schematics
Looking for a door

"In the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military-industrial complex.
The potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist.
We must never let the weight of this combination endanger our liberties or democratic processes.
We should take nothing for granted."
"The prospect of domination of the nation's scholars by Federal employment, project allocations, and the power of money is ever present and is gravely to be regarded.
Yet, in holding scientific research and discovery in respect, as we should, we must also be alert to the equal and opposite danger that public policy could itself become the captive of a scientific technological elite."


What are the odds
What's the statistic
Is there a reason
Or is it pure chance
No treasure box
Or safety deposit
No secret doorway
The lock was in me

Teeth shimmer, reflecting the grin
A familiar looking chin
Six digit figures could never
Buy the state I'm in
At once I'm blessed
Once splintered now become whole
Increase, expand
The reach of the soul

I realize now that what we seek is not of an external nature
But rather to fully grasp the full potential of ourselves
We were born with the most sophisticated equipment known to us
Yet we spend most of our lives searching for something else
Something to come along and rid us of our boredom
As if we were afraid to look into ourselves
Afraid of what we might find
Nothing scares me more than this fear


Every generation lives
In the shadows of the last
This one's no exception
Before traditions set the rules
But this is something new
There are no directions

All or nothing
We are stuffing
Our waistlines increasing
And with it IQs are dropping
Keep on pushing
Blame it on Cushing
Sit down, take it easy you know
There's no point in rushing

Hey, we're slaves of the plethora season
No work to be done
So chill now everyone
Hey, we're suffering from indulgence syndrome
Nothing but joy
We have no choice

There's a theme park called the west
With high fences all around
So there'll be no distractions
Here we do what we do best
Exploiting everyone
In search of perfection

All or nothing
We are suffering
Taking their oil and their lives
And there's still no cuffing
No dominion
No opinion
There's not a new law or decision
That we're not in on

Hey, we're slaves of the plethora season
We need all the gas
To move that thriving ass
Hey, we live in the immunity zone
Time to rejoice
Boys and toys

In our corner of the world
Got nothing much to fear
So we turn on each other
Some girls have formed a plan
Goes straight past equality
This without deception
Injustice for ten thousand years
Now blaming anyone
Who can get an erection [?]

All or nothing
They're not bluffing

Hey, we're slaves of the plethora season
Those who have none in crotch
They've finally grown nuts
Hey, we're standing in the enemy zone
Let's head on home
Y chromosome


What am I waiting for
What do I hope to find
Lying here inside my mind
So much scattered energy
Falling in between
Focusing on how I hurt
Introvert

I search my heart I search my soul
A bust without console
I search the ground I search for more
I just can't find the door
I can't decide I can't control
I lost control
I have no faith I have no goal
I have nothing
Nothing to explore

Paralyzed from the neck up
No twinkle in my eye
And I have no devotion
No chills down my spine
Paralyzed but in slow motion
Like a zombie
I keep on moving round and round
Making sure I can't be found

Panic rising from inside
Adrenaline set in
Still I won't move an inch
The world outside passes me by
With the blinding speed of light
Captured ghosts on retinas
Fading out

I never laugh I never feel
It's hard to conceal
I never hurt I never heal
What is fake, what's for real
I don't believe I believe
I would've never believed
I would never believe again
I don't believe this
Believe me I never would've believed
You'd believe me if I told you how
If I told you how I feel

Paralyzed from the neck up
No twinkle in my eye
And I show no emotion
No tears fall at goodbye
Paralyzed like from some potion
I'm gripped by this stunning notion
A sensation so profound
I cannot make a sound

Apathy spreads fast through me
Like gangrene dark and cold
Life and death entangled
Infection growing sore
We all know the outcome
From that struggle in the past
So what am I waiting for


Thoughts make up the pages
The page contains the thought
Burning for the winds of changes
But that wind will feed the fire

Ash to ash - stories ending
Dust to dust - flakes ascending
Burn debris burn - the breath of writers
Choke on smoke - freedom fighters

In order to deny the story
The story must be read
To judge if harm can be inflicted
You must inflict the harm

Ash to ash - innocence lost
Dust to dust - this is the cost
Censoring truth - leftovers buried
In our minds - still residing

In retrospect
There's plenty left
To tell the facts behind the lies
Put sound to every pantomime

Imperative
Should not outlive
The modal verbs of humbleness
The what if, maybe and I guess

Still trapped beneath
The boulders of authority
Whispered phrases dodging
Immature publicity
Every aspect covered
Except the danger
Of airborne phonetics
Hitting the tympanic
The long lost written words
The long lost written words
Spoken out loud

If regressive new ideas must vanish
The idea is still regress
The pureness of the soul in danger
The danger is the soul

Ash to ash - lives are ending
Dust to dust - flakes ascending
Heinrich Heine - your words still echo
Lost and found - author unknown
Author unknown


I could have gladly asked for more
But your look was saying: "I saw you"
And as you turned away
I mumbled out that I adore you
But I knew within
That forced upon a choice I'd run
And once again chagrined
Defeated by my very own hand

I am my own worst enemy
I am the last man who can set me free

Ain't it time you made up your mind
Guiding voices pointing at the road ahead
Leading straight to nowhere
Temptations; never hard to find
But to resist will always be the battle
That will come back and haunt you

I am my own worst enemy
I am the last man who can set me free

Go without, go within
Go where no one's ever been till you know
Rid your doubts, shed your skin
Feel the loss so you can win over your foe
Only then will you know

Catching up with the train that ran off
Early warnings told that no seat'd be free
If I waited too long
This time I do intend to stay on
Delusions passing by as I stare out
Into the void surrounding

I am my own worst enemy
I am the last man who can set me free

And as the silence wail
I tell myself all over
That if this just begun
I know this will always go on


There is something in the way that she talks to me
That makes me wonder if I'm really free or not

You are my star

You're a special kind of girl
The things that you say to me
They wander through my head
I am falling out of these boundaries that were made to break

You are my star

As galaxies appear those white sparks are creeping near
I'm no longer touching ground
This celestial incarcerator, my soft spoken vindicator
Circling around

Euphoria, I've arrived through my novas gentle care
Travelled through time and space to this lair of her

You are my star

Flickering candles far from reach
I know they are there, I just can't see
Blinded by her willingly
She knows what's best for me


Thought these streets always looked so empty
Paved with wet stones and oil
Flash of turn back to the gutter
Brief encounters all end with a slam
Then a presence stirs around me
I around and there's you
Seeking confrontation and contact
Filling the void with human touch
You feel the rush
Just like a crush

Take another step towards the light
You say you can be trusted
But something doesn't feel just right
Take another step no I won't bite
I'm all alone out walking
There is no one else in sight
Take another step
Take another step
Take another step, are you allright

Question answered without a word
What's wrong with you ain't physical
In a second arm twisted behind me
And my face pressed against the wall
Whispers ask for my belongings
Cellphone, wallet and the ring
There is nothing that I can't give you
There is nothing I cannot give
If you let me live
If you let me live

Take another look into my eye
You're stealing everything
But cannot ever take my pride
Take another coin, see if I care
Raping every pocket
But my integrity's not there
Take another thing
Take another ring
Take another swing
I won't fight back

Take another step, let's not deny
Strauss was on to something
And then Nietzsche got it right
Take another step, another crime
A small one for you maybe
But a giant for mankind
It's another step
It's another step
It's another step back for humankind


Tears escape from my eyes
As I'm reminded once again
By the failure of our kind
We're closing up this shop for good
Since we plundered all that we could
What will it take for you to open up your squinting eyes

It's who we are
It's who we are

You can't own what you loan
A short time we've claimed this soil
Which really is no mans land
Time is short, we're running out
But not of ideas of how to squeeze out
The last drops of the borrowed world we call our own

It's who we are
Can we accept and just go on?
It's who we are
We're trading off the breaking dawn

Unknowing you blend into the dough
Handing your votes to those who are thought of to know
What is left to say

It's sickening me when they're raking in
They couldn't care less as long as they win
It's sickening me when those who have it all
Elbows others to get some more
It's sickening that they'd rather rape the earth
And claim that they're just quenching out thirst
It's sickening how we choose to neglect
How it all unfolds

A vestigial prophecy
Of tomorrows floating orb of debris
A faded memory
Drained out it monuments
The echoes of ashamed lament
Of what evolved from silent consent

As a phantom of the past
Holding the cast

As the shadow of a lucent moon
Burned out light years too soon
Benighted we fail to attune
This acheronian state, is it our fate
Way out of sight
Absorbed by night

An endless line
Running past the signs
Thus condoning the fall of all

Shadow of a lucent moon
Burned out light years too soon
Benighted we fail to attune
This acheronian state, is it our fate
Way out of sight
Absorbed by night

It's sickening me how we're wearing down
What is in our care to hand it on
It's sickening me how we fail to see
That all of this just ain't meant for you and me


Inverting the inverted in disguise
The past becomes alive within their minds
Rotten to the core, so old and foul -
Pages that rule their way of life
Eyes and ears forever sealed shut
Kneeling spiritually autistic sheep
Wide open now to take it all in
- Orders from high above

Can you see what they do
Erasing, re-writing the truth
Can you hear what they say -
One God, one path - Amen

Seven days
To replace an ocean of time
Discard all reason and pave the way
The science of God has arrived

Right through your eyes
The light now does shine
Blinding you - this veil of illumination
Across the world
The light now goes dim
Darkened by this veil - called salvation

From Genesis and onwards
Everything's been set
Crown of the creation
Everything is ours
Mother Nature weeps
Subjected to abuse
Naked apes with hubris
Shameless pseudo prophets

Can you see what they do
Erasing, re-writing the truth
Can you hear what they say -
One God, one creed - Amen

Spreading out - infiltrating high and low
Discard your questions and shut your mouth
The silence of God has arrived

Right through your soul
The light now does shine
Blinding you - this veil of illumination
Across the world
The light now goes dim
Darkened by this veil - called redemption

Inverting and dismembering their souls
Dogmatic scum - deceptive angel-ghouls
Histrionics, tongues that speak entwined
Preaching sickness right into the spine
Eyes and ears forever sealed shut
Kneeling spiritually autistic sheep
Wide open now, dead inside
Laughter from high above

Can you see what they do
Erasing, re-writing the truth
Can you hear what they say -
One God, one creed - Amen

Pave the way - enemies shall not be spared
What once was written must be true
The science of God has arrived

Right through your eyes
The light now does shine
Blinding you - this veil of illumination
Across the world
The light now goes dim
Darkened by this veil - called salvation

ANDROMEDA LYRICS


Under the surface
Behind these walls
This is where I'm hiding
Hiding from the world
This armoured vessel
This steel can is my home
And I can't get out
And no one can get in

No more will you see me again
And oh, I'll never see the light of day
And I know I've been under so, under so long
Hanging on to my only hope
When I feel that I just can't cope
I'm looking through my periscope

In a shallow environment I've been taught to live
But I always wondered what was in the deep
Trapped in the indecision of which way to go
Where it's safe and home or where no one has gone

Oh, I don't know why I don't get along
Got too much energy but I still belong
To a world where all my questions are wrong
And they won't ever understand me, so
Hanging on to my only hope
Still looking through my periscope

I have a question I would like to ask
To who's ever listening
To myself
Does everything that you give come back to you
And if nothing's offered you might as well be dead

Oh no, I have a lot more to give
But I don't
Don't know how to let it out
Let it show
Not even to the people I know
So here I go

Her I go
Hanging on to my only hope
I'm looking through my periscope


Pointing fingers mark the way the riches and success
Those who couldn't make it won't be satisfied for less
Fulfilling visions dreams where others failed that is our quest
Trademark of a caring soul is to always know what's best

Experience and innocence are currencies in trade
Separate the stupid from the clever with a grade
Ability and character determined at a glance
Do you choose your fate or do you give in to circumstance

Working hard for a cause we've never known
That's not our own, but

In the end
We don't need directions
To understand
What we should embrace
And what we should transcend
When we pass it on ourselves
Remember then
It makes all the difference in the end

Social climbers step on souls and hearts to reach the top
They've been told to not look back or down 'cause then you'll drop
Inflicting pain on anyone who's standing in their way
Placing blame is easier than watching what you say

Waking up to a world we've never known
The curtain's down, the cover's blown
Waking up to a world we've never known
All sense's gone, but

In the end
We don't need injections
To understand
What we should embrace
And what we should transcend
When we pass it on ourselves
Remember then
It makes all the difference in the end

And if you think you've had enough
If you're thinking that has to stop
If you're giving up
Stop

Looking up for a god we've never known
They say he's there just say your prayer
Looking up for a god we've never known
We're all alone but

In the end
We don't need religion
To understand
What we should embrace
And what we should transcend
When we pass it on ourselves
Remember then
It makes all the difference in the end


Take your time but hurry up
Don't get tied but settle
Find some time to socialize
Solve the hidden riddle

Well I've been told
That no other one will understand
Nor solve the hidden riddle
Yes I've been told
That no other one than the chosen son
Will solve the hidden riddle

I arrived in darkened light
Of endless deprivation
Lost in sense of wrong and right
I'm here for the salvation
Clouded minds you're cold inside
Climbing your own ladder
When in fright you run and hide
I'll show you just what matters

We'll I'm the one that you called upon
That was begged to come
To solve the hidden riddle
Now I am here
In your presence near
And your greatest fear
Is to solve your hidden riddle

Relax my son, you are my chosen one
But not this way, I for your pray
Your infected mind has made you blind
All your shame I do not need to see
The riddle that is in your mind
And you find in yourself left behind
Come out of your castle of sand
Lend me your hand
I am not the one you need to free

Forever and ever
Beside of me you have none
The pain will go on
You won't believe it's true
Forever and ever
Without me you'll all be gone
The pain will go on
Whatever doubts I'll prove

Well I've been told
That no other one will understand
Nor solve the hidden riddle
Yes I've been told
That no other one than the chosen son
Will solve the hidden riddle

Forever and ever
Beside of me you have none
The pain will go on
You won't believe it's true
Forever and ever
Without me you'll all be gone
The pain will go on
Whatever doubts I'll prove


So now the end is here I have no fear
I lean my head on the ground
I can not feel my legs and my arms are going numb
But I still see the shapes gathered round

Staring figures, features frozen
Skins are pale and mouth are open
Someone's leaning forward saying
Try to breathe, soon help is coming
Hold on

Leave me here no need to bother
Just look at me, I won't recover
Don't forget to tell her that I love her
Now let me down, I'm going under

All the bitterness and hate is left behind
It's a relief, it's a high
I see my life pass by before my eyes
And there's no reason to ask why
High, high, high...
I leave it all behind
Hold on

Leave me here no need to bother
Just look at me, I won't recover
Don't forget to tell her that I love her
Now let me down, I'm going under

Hallucination or for real, I start to feel
Like I am floating in the air, I'm everywhere

Colours shifting patterns intertwining
Transparent angels singing
Come with us come with us come with us come with us
A tunnel rising ascending slowly
White clouds form a path in limelight
Come with us come with us come with us

So here I stand at the stairs looking down
I see myself on the ground
I look into my eyes, they're telling me
An inner peace has been found

Electric shock, I'm back from yonder
The pain is too, now even stronger
Someone's leaning forward saying
Welcome back son, how're you doing
Hold on

Leave me here no need to bother
Just look at me, I won't recover
Don't forget to tell her that I love her
Now let me down, I'm going under

Leave me now
Let me down
Now


A stranger to the night
I dwell in light, can not live without
Those healing beams make me go on
Peace is found inside
In flood or tide, winter spring summer fall
But when the sun is gone

And I fail to be
And this difference is a pain to bear
Although a mystery
I pray for it to end
But there's no response
And I fall again
My moral breaks
My limits I bend

Till I hurt you, I curse you
I strike your head until I burst through
I live it out, live it out, live it out, scream
Then I wake up from this wicked dream
Till I hurt you, I curse you
I strike your head until I burst through
I live it out, live it out, live it out, scream
Then I wake up from this wicked dream

Eyes are opened wide
I cannot hide, the fear I keep inside
To all who rest assured enjoy
My envy will unleash
As my weary eyes shuts with fatigue
The lights are out and here's my show

I release myself
From the cage that I now despise
With the night I come
In wrath I rise
Cause I've been constrained
But this shell that is left behind
There's no sympathy
My hate is blind, I hope you don't mind

Till I hurt you, I curse you
I strike your head until I burst through
I live it out, live it out, live it out, scream
Then I wake up from this wicked dream
Till I hurt you, I curse you
I strike your head until I burst through
I live it out, live it out, live it out, scream
Then I wake up from this wicked dream

Bruised and battered I wander among you
And I laugh and I smile as you're accustomed to
But behind my wall that you don't seem to see
I pray that someday I'll be all of me
Should I defect from life itself
Since it turned it's back on me

Hey, if you gotta go then you wanna know
I'm buried deep inside and I won't let go
In your darkness I will glow
Hey, if you gotta go then you wanna know
I'm on the other side beckoning you to come
Then I can run my show

And I'll hurt you, I curse you
I strike your head until I burst through
I live it out, live it out, live it out, scream
Don't you agree that we're one hell of a team
Well I hurt you, I curse you
I strike your head until I burst through
I live it out, live it out, live it out, scream
Then you wish it was just a dream


My ambition from the start
Was to rely upon my heart
I would not follow
Through every door you opened wide
For me to sneak a peak inside
I solely turned
To the path of my demise
Where you turned right
I turned wrong

If you got it made
If you got all that you craved
If you got away
I'll tell you now you're all the same
I'm falling without ties
I am the one that truly failed

I see you walking by each day
With a frown that tells of your dismay
I reek and stretch out
My empty, lifeless, withered hand
This did not turn out as I planned
I too had dreams
'bout a time and 'bout a place
Instead I live by your grace

You all got it made
You got all that you craved
I guess you must have prayed
All of you who not derailed
For you I hide my eyes
And yeah I realize
I am the one that truly failed

There's always time to tantalize
Always room for analyze
Of the misguided man
Judge not the unfortune one
It could have been your only son
You rose high I tell low
Reaching for the pennies you throw
Humiliated I fawn
For every time you make it
Every time I'm mistaken
And I know when I am gone
No one will ever know

My ambition from the start
Was to rely upon my heart
Now the beats are weakening
My omission of the verity
Made the search of false prosperity
A lure of grandeur

If you embark in my trail
Preconvinced you'll prevail
I'll bequeath no guidelines
You're alone when you fail

If you got it made
If you got all that you craved
If you got away
I'll tell you now you're all the same
I am the one who cries
I'm falling without ties
I am the one that truly failed
You got all that you craved
I guess you must have prayed
All of you who not derailed
For you I hide my eyes
Yes I realize
I am the one that truly failed


Stone on stone
Forming defenses from the crowd
Brick by brick climbing the sky
No asking where when or now
Nor solving the mystery of why

Supposed to lead us all as one
The only thing they do is lead us on
So just be careful where you tread
Obstacles and traps ahead

Mudfilled trenches, barbwired fences
Spotlights on the wall
Guards assemble, fingers tremble
As the sirens call
But nothing's gonna stop us
Till the inner circle falls

Step by step advancing
Closer to the core
Megaphones that never cease
Old slogans all heard before
Shout freedom as a metaphor for peace
Oh please

The rising drawbridge's not so far
We're run as catapults recharge
It is no longer safe to hide
See you on the other side

Mudfilled trenches, barbwired fences
Spotlights on the wall
Guards assemble, fingers tremble
As the sirens call
But nothing's gonna stop us
Till the inner circle falls


Oh I wanna be there
Where the stones lie still around you
Oh I wanna be there
Where the fire will not harm you
There's a place I always go when I'm feeling lost
When I'm cold
And when there's no shelter from the storm
Iskenderun

So I fall back into myself
Stare at the pearl inside this shell

And I have to go
A world in the sun
The darkness is gone
Iskenderun
And I'm all alone
Under the sun
Iskenderun
Iskenderun

Another Celtic Telamon
Another Persian Salamis
There is no guilt not innocence
There is no us and them
Jerusalem

Oh I wanna be there
Where the stones lie still around you
Oh I wanna be there
Where the fire will not harm you

Look what they've done, look what they've done
Everything's gone, everything's wrong

So I have to go
Nowhere to run
Look what they've done
Iskenderun
And I'm all alone
Under the sun
Iskenderun
Iskenderun

Terrorists are walking around me
And I walk among them
War lords, Nazis, kamikazes
When will they
When will they stop

Oh I wanna be there
Where the stones lie still around you
Oh I wanna be there
Where the fire will not harm you

Oh but the truth is
This is a place
Where I've never been
And I've never seen


Sacrifice paradise
Ignorance, malice, ambition combined
Second prize don't entice
Indoctrinated we stand alongside
Enterprise in disguise
And our eyes, and our eyes begin to wander the sky
Telling lies, alibis
And we cry, and we cry as they start to multiply

This sleep here in front of me
Six miles from side to side
A caprice of geology
Standing mountain high
The wall whispers no apology
Doesn't answer why
The landscape changes radically
As it's reaching for the sky

And no one can pass by
No matter how you try
And if they let you in
You can't come out again

The flood will descend from here
And everything will fall
An arrogant decision
Our destiny for all
No serum intended here
No antidote in mind
All the species all the plants
From the beginning of all time
All gone away in the blink of an eye

Sacrifice paradise
Ignorance, malice, ambition combined
Second prize don't entice
Indoctrinated we stand alongside
Enterprise in disguise
And our eyes, and our eyes begin to wander the sky
Telling lies, alibis
And we cry, and we cry as they start to multiply

From the comfort of leather chairs
Turn jungles into fields
A segregated conference
Outsiders forced to yield
And those who cannot wield a pen
Or haven't got a voice
Are all labeled incompetent
And they're all bereft of choice

And no one will be spared
There's vermin in the air
And they don't even care
This will reach everywhere

The fire ignited here
Will spread from coast to coast
The center of attention
Yet overlooked by most
No island, no refuge made
These ultraviolet waves
Infiltrating everything
And everyone inside
All gone away in the blink of an eye

ANDROMEDA LYRICS


Turning the page, write to cease new ideas
Thoughts - all duly recorded
Maybe someday, all the rhymes, given time
Would get justly rewarded

So long ago, you don't even know how it started
So there you go
Stashing the sketches and drafts of what has become an

Encyclopedia of all the things you've done
Expect the media to bother when you're gone

Hours and hours of sacrifice, no compromise
Forced as if under orders
Planning to take land sea and skies, but can't decide
When to cross the borders

Encyclopedia of all there is to know
Encyclopedia - but what is there to show

The piles just seem to grow
Is this ambitions one man show
There's only one man watching you, John Doe
He's both on stage and in the front row

Encyclopedia - your one and only friend
Encyclopedia - will pay off in the end

Turning around, the objective of the way you lived
Hypothetical fortune, suddenly found
You're at the gate - it's too late
Psychological torture

So long ago, since you should have put it all out there
So now you go
Leaving for us to discover the paths you have tread

Encyclopedia - all written by his hand
Encyclopedia - will we ever understand

Now he will never know
Swept away by the undertow
The world is listening now, John Doe
Come back and reap what you have sown


I could have pushed you out that day
That would have been the easy way
Watch you fly down that hundred meter fall
I wouldn't care at all

Falling, falling, drowning
Inhaling and you're screaming
Screaming... Pleading don't go

Mirages - as I hurt you in my mind
As the memories unwind
Mirages - as you led me to believe
In things that only you conceive

Why do you play that vicious game
I ask myself most every day
So high, that hundred meter fall
I turn around and there you are

Falling, falling, drowning
Inhaling and I'm screaming
Screaming... Pleading... Bleeding

Victoria falls were much too real
It's beauty false though now I see
Please try to explain
What was the aim, what was the gain
No matter how I try to wash it off
The stains remain

(We are gathered here today
To say our last farewells
We fell so hard down that hundred meter fall
Now - only stains of us remain)

Mirages - as you twisted with my mind
As you told me I was blind
Mirages - well constructed to deceive
The trusty and naive
Mirages - as you offered no reprieve
From the hell you had achieved
Mirages - as I finally could see
That there was nothing to conceive


I can turn away and hold my breath a day
But I can't escape the stench of the lie
That's haunting my mind
I won't be free even if I'm deaf, dumb and blind

All those weary eyes with their wicked smiles
They come to my dreams, they're watching us now
They're after my head, they're after my life
Why can't they stay dead?


I confess to my sin, reaching deep within
It comes straight from my heart, where should I start
In revealing my thoughts, reaching deep within
I'm just letting it out and letting you in
Reaching within

It was so long ago, or was it yesterday
I can't seem to find a thread in my mind
A needle that's sharp that will make me whole
That's mending my soul

It's hard for me to plead, for your empathy
When hatred persists, whom can I persuade?
To forgive and forget
I threw the stone but I stand alone



Dig in my head and you'll find what is on my mind
Take it all out, I insist that it won't be missed
Wake up the slumbering man,
Give him time to adapt to your world, I just know he can




Living alone
Is not the way for me
Words on the phone
They fade and die as I put it down
Feel like a stone
Emotionless, hard and cold
All on my own
I just can't find the way


So tell me I'm dreaming
Please wake me up
Pinch my arm as hard as you want
'Cause all of this madness
Makes sense when you're here
One & one is two, but not when two is one

Tired and slow
Time crawls by us now
Distance's a foe
Far, far too strong for my weary mind
Opening the door
The world lies endless, there below
Don't know where to go
I just can't find the way



What good are numbers anyway
They put perspective on the game
But we're playing off the board
Oh the rules do not apply

I feel it, the energy
Keeping contact intravenously
Floating chemistry
Protones, electrones, forming atoms, molecules
Into complex lifeforms

So in perspective of the game
What good are numbers anyway
When we're playing off the board
Oh the rules do not apply

Tears from the ceiling
That's how I'm feeling
Falling - forgiving
Call of the living

Tell me I'm dreaming
Please wake me up
Pinch my arm as hard as you want

Tears from the ceiling
Tell me I'm dreaming
Water fulfilling
Life - a new meaning

So tell me I'm dreaming
Please wake me up
Pinch my arm as hard as you want
'Cause all of this madness
Makes sense when you're here
One & one is two, but not when two is one
But if you count you lose the point

So in perspective of the game
What good are numbers anyway
When we're playing off the board
Oh the rules do not apply





At the time I left land and sailed away
Never knew I would end up a castaway
Wind went hard and the sky had tears for me
The sea was all that I saw, my enemy

There are days that I wake up and strongly believe
There are ways to escape, I myself might deceive
In the bottles I've sent, I reached out for a hand
But as sure as I'm here, they have never seen land


Castaway, your clouds are in the way of light
I am stumbling blind
Castaway, your thoughts, remembered by the prints
That I left behind

I know, but it's so hard to show
Myself a way, to a better day
I know that I am destined to live
A life in memory, companion to my misery

I've seen ships passing by, but they've never seen me
And for each day that pass without being free
I will moulder within with nothing to win
I will gamble my soul to pay any toll
Isolation I face every day, every night
What is real what is not, I keep losing my sight
Who's to care who's to not, I just never might know
For the son God forgot, maybe someday, I hope someday they'll show

I used to love the snow
Can I reach it now
Beyond my dreams somehow
Only the stars look the same
How I'd love to know their names



I know, but it's so hard to show
Myself a way, to a better day
I know that I am destined to live
Trapped by the sea, living in your memory


I sit in darkness cold and wait
Searching in my mind
My watch has stopped at half past eight
And I can't recall a thing
I won't accept this divided state
Where two are trapped in one
I'd ask them to communicate
If I knew how

(I am the one of your fears
In your head, in your bed, in your dreams - or so it seems
Am I too much
I have no fears, have no tears
And might I add, like I said;
Am I too much)

They're starting to interrogate, looking for a sign
Trying to intimidate, "we know you were there that night"
It seems it's getting far too late to find an easy out
But how am I to indicate that it was eye

(I am the one of your fears
In your head, in your bed, in your dreams - or so it seems
Am I too much
I have no fears, have no tears
And once again, little friend;
Am I too much)

I wake before the curtains fall, just in time to see
His devastating work of art, acknowledged and signed by me
And you... you just... just cry
I...

I, oh I got so much I wanna say
Yeah, so many things I've kept away
All the lying, all denying, all the little bricks in his game
So clear to me, yet so obscured
If anyone could help me out, if anyone just anyone
But if anyone would find me out
I couldn't bear, I wouldn't dare...
So I play


The time has come to contemplate
My dearest parasite
You take me to a state of hate
Where reason just don't apply
This secret curse can't be my fate
Or something I've deserved
My mind is set to liberate
Itself from you

I look into your eye, I let go of my pride
I confess to the lie, I look straight into your ...
I am the one, one in my head
I have no fears, I have no tears
I am the one, one in my head
I have no fears, I have no tears

I banged my head against the wall
Ran around in circles
Scratched my itchy skin until I bled
Crossed my bloody fingers
Kneeled down and prayed
Oh father are you in heaven
What is in my defense
I've committed sins, all seven
Is there time to make amends
Eight nine ten eleven
Escalating fast
Could I have changed the past or present
And for how long will it last

It's like I'm being cursed
I just can't quench this thirst
But now I'm ready to burst
You know, I was in here first

I am the one, one in my head
I have no fears, I have no tears
I am the one, one that you dread
I have no fears, I have no tears


I open up my eye and I, I open as my eye
I stare and let it read my mind, eye open as am I
Scanning through that tangled maze I lose myself again
Who am I whose eye defines the thoughts run through my head
And soon I find there's no way out, my eye is my guide again

Showing me around, these pathways so profound
Shining like the sun, I pretend it's just for fun
As he forces me to run again
Asking would you like to be my friend

Eye look into eye and I try to draw the line
Fight that lie and hide my fright, keep it out of mind
Far away I hear a voice that shouts and demands
Syllables and letters forming words of command
Closer now, then from inside, I think that I understand

Showing you around, these pathways so profound
Shining like the sun, I pretend it's just for fun
As I force you with a gun - run, run
Asking would you like to be my friend

I look into your eye, I pretend it's all fine
I keep living the lie, I look into your eye

(This fragile surface may hold the weight of all that's locked inside
But will it help you clean your slate, or do you just run and hide
You can run...)

This fragile surface white and blue if studied will reveal
There's something in the depths below that I cannot conceal
Through years and years of acting and the practice of my stare
Has made it easy to escape if you didn't already know it was there

This fragile mirror of the soul reflects both fake and real
But before you see too much of me I'll turn or keep it sealed
So I face the ground and hurry on, I run from how I feel
To tell you 'bout my self-inflicted wounds that will never heal

ANDROMEDA LYRICS


There's a million things I'd like to say
But you turn your back, refuse to hear
So, I keep it inside and watch you walk away
But, the vision and the words, will not disappear

So, what is it that you fear, as you turn your face?
There is more in this world, than meets the eye;
Reality is what we choose to see and believe

There's a million things you'd like to tell
But, I think I've heard it all before
And I know I'm wrong, I know it so well
Never will I listen to you, nevermore

There's a million things I'd like to say
But you turn your back, refuse to hear
So, I keep it inside and watch you walk away
But, the vision and the words, will not disappear

The feelings we've kept inside,
and the tears we've denied
Always remember it's bitter taste
Remember it's token; remember the words


Opened wide, eyes to see,
Within, beyond and behind
Faces never seen,
My mind is expiring, beyond all limits

Impulses and thoughts torn
into meaningless words

The darkest of demons are hidden
behind the happiest faces
I wear the mask of fear

Impulses and thoughts torn
into meaningless words
stained on this paper, like the liquid of life
from a slit wrist

I have nothing to say, yet I desperately search
searching for the shadows of mine
yet undiscovered, hidden within

Opened wide, eyes to see,
Within, beyond and behind
Faces never seen

I have nothing to say, yet I desperately search
searching for the shadows of mine
yet undiscovered, hidden within

Impulses and thoughts torn
into meaningless words
stained on this paper, like the liquid of life
from a slit wrist


In the depths I saw something beckoning me
An ugly shape deep down in the sea
In the corner of my eye, an inner world so blind
But I know, yes I know; it's only in my mind

In the depths I mirror myself, twisted reflections
It is not me, must be a wicked imagination
In the language of sorrow at the bottom of the sea
The shape turns it's head and speaks to me

I am too many for my shadow on the wall
Into the deepest of water we hand in hand fall
Voices do surround, sadness is unbound
We dive, tranquillity in death is found

A shadow walks beside me, my liquid gemini
As I weep, It laughs, above the silent sky
And as I laugh, It kills me with every passing second,
with every passing second...In the deepest of waters...

I am too many for my shadow on the wall
Into the deepest of waters we hand in hand fall
Voices do surround, sadness is unbound
We dive, tranquillity in death is found...

In the depths I saw something beckoning me
An ugly shape deep down in the sea
In the corner of my eye, an inner world so blind
But I know, yes I know; it's only in my mind

In the language of sorrow at the bottom of the sea
The shape turns its head and speaks to me





I wanna ride on a shooting star
Ride through cosmos so very far
See the ground down there below
The speed of light's our only foe
A mighty milkyway crusade
Nothing can make the feeling fade
Floating skywards at the speed of light
Oh, yeah what a beautiful flight!

Turn your head to the skies
Embrace that which never dies
Behold, for it's not a dream
It's me star shooter supreme!

Hello Terra Firma! Here we come!
Yeah! We're having some astral fun
Circle of friends, planets in motion
And the sun has a smile like an ocean

Mighty milkyway crusade
Nothing can make the feeling fade
Floating skywards at the speed of light
Oh, yeah what a beautiful flight!

Turn your head against the skies
Embrace that which never dies
Behold, for it's not a dream
It's me start shooter supreme!

Ride on my brothers, fly on
Descending fast, but still we have won
A mighty milkyway crusade
Nothing can make the feeling fade
Ride on my brothers, fly on
Descending fast, but still we have won
Floating skywards at the speed of light
Hell yeah, what a beautiful flight!
Come on!

Turn your head to the skies
Embrace that which never dies
Behold, for it's not a dream
It's me star shooter supreme
Turn your head against skies
Embrace that which never dies
Behold, for it's not a dream
It's me star shooter supreme
Oh yeah!


This is where I stand
This is who I am
This is the way it had to be
Arrows point in every direction
Where to turn, seek to learn;
Lies in the sand of time

Closing my mind to remember
But there is nothing to forget
All I ever had is here, before me
Open up the opened and collect

This is the written word
This is who I am
This is the extension of the wish;
Conviction will blossom,
As failure laughs in my face
I'll still be waiting for my turn

Closing my mind to remember
But there is nothing to forget
All I ever had is here, before me
Open up the opened and collect

Closing my mind to remember
But there is nothing to forget
All I ever had is here, before me
Open up the opened and collect


Again and again I fall into your arms
Your embrace; my only true home
My sanctuary from the cold outside
Your embrace; my only destiny

Archangel, come spread your wings around me
Give me air to breathe and tears to shed
Archangel, come spread your wings around me
Give me air to breathe and tears to shed
Feed me lies of hope; words so bittersweet
Save me from myself and the agony within

Archangel, come spread your wings around me
Cure my fever, heal my longing, everlasting

For this world, was not created for you and me
Naked, unprotected we have fallen, down

We all live like we are going to die

We are here we are high

And this is why we love to live our lives

You cannot kill the party

You cannot kill the party

The conquest will survive

The more that you can give it, then the more it will be
And if you do not have it, you can take it from me
All we ever wanted was a thing to believe,
And now that we have found it, we have all that we need.

The more that you can give it, then the more it will be
And if you do not have it, you can take it from me
All we ever wanted was a thing to believe,
And now that we have found it, we have all that we need.

We have found our pride


And if any last one of you ever likes to be part of this war, part of it, you get out, you get out, you get out, one two oh,

I met a lot of friends who were cool
But a lot of them were jerks
And when I found about the trouble I was causing
It only made me act even worse.

I played a lot of horrible songs
Yeah, a lot of them were bad
And when I listen back to the way I used to play,
It only made me even more mad

I used to take what I wanted for free
I only ever saw what I wanted to see
We were jerks, we were bad and that's all I ever wanted to be.

Tear It Up Tear It Up Tear It Up Tear It Up Tear It Up
Tear It Up all night

Tear It Up Tear It Up all right.

Come on, you've got none, you want it
you cant give in, you get out, you're bad come on.

I never cared much about rules
And I did what I wanted in school
I hung out on my own, I went it alone
And I probably really looked like fool

But I did it like I'm top of the rope,
And I'll do it like I'm top of the rope.
Until I let go, until I let go,
I'll always tear it up on my own.

Tear It Up Tear It Up Tear It Up Tear It Up Tear It Up
Tear It Up all night
Tear It Up up up up up up up
Tear It Up Tear It Up all right
Tear It Up Tear It Up Tear It Up Tear It Up Tear It Up

Tear It Up Tear It Up all right
Tear It Up Tear It Up Tear It Up Tear It Up Tear It Up
Tear It Up all night
Tear It Up up up up up up up
Tear It Up Tear It Up all right


You walked out on your best
But you knew they would never pass the test
They mess your life around
But your life's taking their life
Taking them down

And you never give it up
When they stab you in your back
Because their backs are going to break when you go
So you jump jump jump jump jump jump jump jump
They're not going to hurt you anymore

You never give it up
Give it up give it up
No you never give it up
You don't
And you jump jump jump jump jump jump jump jump
You're going to have to make it on your own

They just took your last friend
But you knew they would get theirs in the end
You put their lies behind
'Cause your life's taking their life, making them fry

And you never give it up
When they stab you in your back
Because their backs are going to break when you go
So you jump jump jump jump jump jump jump jump
They're not going to hurt you anymore

You never give it up
Give it up give it up
No you never give it up
You don't
And you jump jump jump jump jump jump jump jump
You're going to have to make it on your own


I never want to break your heart
Never want to make you cry
Never want to give up and die

And even if you can't stand up
Even if you lose your light
I'm a friend by your side
You're never going to be alone

You can never let down
Never let down
You can never let down
Never let down
Never let down

I never want to make mistakes
Never want to do no wrong
Never have a place to belong

And I'm never going to leave you out
If you ever lose your way
Not alone or betrayed
I'm always going to be around

You can never let down
Never let down
Never let down

Oh
You're doing alright
You're doing OK
Just follow your heart
And don't run away

You can never let down
You're doing alright
You're doing OK
Just follow your heart
And don't run away

You can never let down
You're doing alright
You're doing OK
Just follow your heart
And don't run away
I never want to break your heart
I never want to break your heart
I never want to break your heart


I don't care what you say
And I won't hit the hay
I don't know what you do
But I know I'm not you
We've got something that you'll never have

And we will never listen to your rules, oh
We will never do what others do, oh
If you want a fight, we'll fight with you, oh
Cause we will never listen to your rules, no

You're not my mom and dad
And even they watch their backs
Cause they know what I hate
Any rules that I can't break

I don't care (I hate work) What you say (So let's play)
And I won't (And don't get) Hit the hay (In my way)
I don't know (I like people) What you do (to be cool)
But I know (I like people) I'm not you (To break rules)
We've got something that you'll never have.

We will never listen to you

And we will never listen to your rules, oh
We will never do what others do, oh
If you want a fight, we'll fight with you, oh
Cause we will never listen to your rules, no
Your rules, no way


Do you really want to go down now?
Do you really want to know where I've been when I go out?
Can you understand what I'm feeling?
And do you understand what it means, man?

When you here the sound
Feels just like a pleasure
And when you hear the sound and you know
We're coming for the sound
Don't ever stop the pleasure
Remember what it's like coming down
And don't stop singing the song

That's what we said, we said

Don't ever stop the song
You can never stop, singing your song
Singing it loud and you're singing it long
And you can never stop
No, never stop, the song

You don't know that sound when it feels bad.
And you lost what you knew So you took what they had
Now you try to take it from others
But try and mess with us and you'll suffer brother!

When you here the sound
Feels just like a pleasure
And when you hear the sound and you know
We're coming for the sound
Don't ever stop the pleasure
Remember what it's like coming down
And don't stop singing the song

That's what we said, we said

Don't ever stop the song
You can never stop, singing your song
Singing it loud and you're singing it long
And you can never stop
No, never stop, the song


I don't wanna make life
And I don't wanna make death
I don't wanna make love
I just wanna (Bang Bang)

I don't wanna make life
And I don't wanna make death
I don't wanna make love
I just wanna (Bang Bang)

I don't wanna make life
And I don't wanna make death
I don't wanna make love
I just wanna
Make sex

Wanna make sex, wanna make sex
Wo oh
Wanna make sex, wanna make sex

Wanna make sex
Wo oh, wo oh
Wanna make sex, make sex

Wanna make sex, wanna make sex
Wo oh
Wanna make sex, wanna make sex

Wanna make sex
Wo oh, wo oh
Wanna make sex,
Make sex


Life's too short
So do what you want
I've said it before and I'll say it again
So everyone just do what you want

People will laugh, and tell you to mop
People will call, and here come the cops
It's all beaten up and going to town
You did what you could, and put the ball out of bounds.

I'm totally stupid
totally stupid
totally stupid.

People don't like
What you do
Give them what they want
Give them what they have
Give them what they are
And they should

People don't care
They tell you what to do
Do what we can
And put the ball out of bounds
And we dig deep pulling out
Out of the ground

I'm totally stupid
I'm totally stupid
I'm totally stupid
I'm totally stupid
Totally stupid
Totally stupid
I'm totally stupid

Would you give up all you want
To keep the things you got
To keep the things you got

And would you give up all you got
To get the things you want
To get the things you want

All the things we want are here
We have to face our fear
We have to face our fear.

When we look into the future
To the place we haven't gone
See what we haven't done
We have known it all along

If we wait until tomorrow
Will tomorrow ever come?
This is where we're coming from
And we're not the only ones

When we find ourselves in trouble
We can find ourselves a way
You can find a place to stay
And the place is always safe

If you have a heart that's in pain
Don't be afraid
You're not to blame
There's a better world inside of us
Where we always thought it was
You don't need to hide
You can open up your eyes

And you'll discover
That there is another, world


I
I am alike
A lot like you
Oh, like you

I do what I want
And I want you
Oh, want you

I learned all that I need to know
To understand I love you so
You get me, I get you, we get us

I can't explain it anymore
I'm not too young to know for sure
You get me, I get you, we get us

I didn't know what I was
Didn't know what I wanted from love
But now I know that I'm right
Even if you won't have me, I don't care.

Because I'm
Really in love
Really in love
I am falling really in love

Really in love
Really in love
I am falling really in love

In love
When I'm saying your name
In love
Know it's not the same
In love
I'm down on my knees
Please don't go

You... you live alone
And I do too
I really really really really want you

You've got no things you need to say
The love I have won't go away
You get me, I get you, we get us

I didn't know what I was
Didn't know what I wanted from love
But now I know that I'm right
Even if you won't have me, I'll keep trying

Cause I'm
Really in love
Really in love
I am falling really in love

Really in love
Really in love
I have fallen really in love

In love
When you're saying my name
In love
Know it's not the same
In love
I'm down on my knees
Please, please, please


Had the power on full
And a reason to run
Learned a little bit slow
But it's better than none

Learned a little bit slow
But at least we had fun

Looking out on the lot
Driving over the dance
Riding up to the top
Bringing lunch in advance

Riding up to the top
Bringing all that I can

If you only do good
And you figure it out
If I do what I should
If I do it all now

Don't be waiting for luck
Find a way to do more
Are we doing this?
What are we doing this for?
Because we can...

Before the end of our lives
The end of our lives
The end of our lives
Before the end of our lives, oh

There were days that I stole
But I also got robbed
So I made a mission my goal
And a vision my job

Made a mission my goal
But the vision got lost

If you only do good
And you figure it out
If I do what I should
If I do it all now

Don't be waiting for luck
Find a way to do more
Are we doing this?
What are we doing this for?

To love the times we have
To like what makes us sad
To live when others die
To lose and say goodbye
To last until our moment comes

But it isn't over
You know it isn't over
You know it isn't over
You know it isn't over
You know it isn't done

Before the end of our lives
The end of our lives
The end of our lives
Before the end of our lives, oh

Just because this life ain't easy
Doesn't make it bad

It isn't over
It can't be over
Be glad


I want you to remember all the things that I said
I want you to remember
you're not better off dead
You only have a minute to go bk in the line
To bring it on home and make up your mind

I want you to remember what you
came here to do
I want you to remember that I'm talking about you

I
Love Music and I Love To feel
I love to get through, I love to get
through

I Love Music and I Love To Yell

In my soul I am running getting nearer

For many years of only hope you'd never leave

You are my faith you are my friend you are my family and I am coming

So we can live forever more in total love

You're in my soul (you're in my soul)
And I am running (I am running)
Getting nearer (I am always getting nearer)

For many years (for many years)
Of only hope (of only hope)
You'd never leave (for many years I hoped you'd never leave)

You are my faith (my faith)
You are my friend (my friend)
You are my family (my family)
And I am coming (and I am coming)

So we can live (so we can live)
For ever more (for ever more)
In total love (so we can live forever more)
In total love

I'm not about to die I'm not a setting sun
I look into your eyes and see what has begun

I'm not about to die (this time we will)
(this time we will unite
I'm not a setting sun (this time we will not)
(this time we will not loose you)
I look into you eyes
(we look into your)
(we look into your eyes and)
And see what has begun
(and see what)
(what has)
(and see the world is...)

In my soul
I am running
Getting nearer
(I am always getting nearer)

For many years
Of only hope
You'd never leave
(for many years I hoped you'd never leave)

You are my faith
You are my
friend
You are my family
And I am coming

So we can live
For ever more
In total love

So we can be there when victory strikes again

ANDREW W.K. LYRICS


["Jackass: The Movie" Soundtrack]Well if we had our own willing way to go
You'd be doing things, and hoping there's antidote!
When we saw that we'd give you it all!
we're thinkin' you're a lady, yankin' our chains an' all!

We can get a try!
We can get a try!
with a 1, 2, 3
You'd be startin' to drown!
We can clear the floor
We'd give you a bangin'
ladies and gentlemen do it together!

We want you to give us something more...
You have to lay down on us!
We want us to get up off the floor...
Don't ever lay down on it!
We don't want to ever live or die!
We gotta get out we can make it today
you gotta HEY! HEY! HEY! HEY! make it today!

We want fun and you better believe it!
We want fun 'cos we desperately need it!
We want fun, but you don't understand...
... you gotta HEY! HEY! HEY! HEY! make me a man!

We want fun and you better believe it!
We want fun either take it, or leave it!
We want fun, and we're gonna get pasted!
We want to have fun, and we want to get wasted!

When we had the time of our life
We'd hook up with the gang and take you through!
Then you'd be in the back of our van
Mum and dad started gettin' real bad!

We want you to give us something more...
You have to lay down on us!
We want us to get up off the floor...
Don't ever lay down on it!
We don't want to ever live or die!
We gotta get out we can make it today
you gotta HEY! HEY! HEY! HEY! make it today!

We want fun and you better believe it!
We want fun 'cos we desperately need it!
We want fun, but you don't understand...
... you gotta HEY! HEY! HEY! HEY! make me a man!

We want fun 'cos we medically need it!
We want fun either take it, or leave it!
We want fun, and we're gonna get pasted!
We want to have fun, and we want to get wasted!

We want pie, want pie, want fun YEAH!
What do we want? What do we want?
We want fun, want pie, want fun YEAH!
What do we want? What do we want?
We want fun, want pie, want pie YEAH!
What do we want? We know what we want!
We want pie, want pie, want pie!
We want to have fun, and we want to get wasted!

People started killing wherever she goes

When she comes she's a red hot set of lips
And when she comes and you just don't know
She won't try and stop you
But she'd go and kick you when you're down on the ground
She just disapoints you
Even though you give it everything you can (all that you can)
You've got to make her understand
That you are a man

(You dont stop!)
She gets what she wants
(You dont stop!)
She gets what she needs
(You dont stop!)
I get what I need
(You dont stop!)
I need your love

You don't stop when they're taking your love (girls own love)
You don't stop when they're making your love (girls own love)
You don't stop when girls own love (girls own love)
You don't stop when girls own love

People started killing wherever she goes

She gets off without you
And when you get it up
She's a puttin' you down
She won't try and stop you
But she'd go and kick you when you're down on the ground
She just disappoints you
Even though you give it everything you can (all that you can)
You've got to make her understand
That you are a man

(You dot stop!)
She gets what she wants
(You dont stop!)
She gets what she needs
(You dont stop!)
I get what I need
(You dont stop!)
I need your love

You don't stop when they're taking your love (girls own love)
You don't stop when they're making your love (girls own love)
You don't stop when girls own love (girls own love)
You don't stop when girls own love

NA-NA-NA-NA-NA-NA-NA-NA-NA-NA-NA-NA
NA-NA-NA-NA-NA-NA-NA-NA-NA-NA-NA Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah!

You don't stop when they're taking your love (girls own love)
You don't stop when they're making your love (girls own love)
You don't stop when girls own love (girls own love)
You don't stop when girls own love (girls own love)


This is your time to Pay,
This is your Judgement Day.
We made a Sacrifice,
And now we get to take your life.
We shoot without a Gun,
We'll take on Anyone.
It's really nothing new,
It's just a thing we like to do.


You'd better get Ready to Die,
(Get ready to Die).
You'd better get Ready to Kill,
(get ready to Kill).
You'd better get Ready to Run,
Coz,
Here we come.
You'd better get Ready to Die,
(Get Ready to Die).

Your life is over now,
Your life is running out.
When your time is at an End,
Then it's time to Kill again.
We Cut without a Knife,
We live in Black and White.
You're just a Parasite,
Now close you're eyes and say Good Night.


You'd better get Ready to Die,
(Get ready to Die).
You'd better get Ready to Kill,
(get ready to Kill).
You'd better get Ready to Run,
Coz,
Here we come.
You'd better get Ready to Die,
(Get Ready to Die).
You'd better get Ready to Die,
Get Ready to Die,
Get Ready to Die,
Get Ready to Die.
You'd better get Ready to Die,
Get Ready to Die,
Get Ready to Die,
Get Ready to Die.
You'd better get Ready to Die,
Get Ready to Die,
Get Ready to Die,
Get Ready to...
If we're not,
Not coming,
Then you better get Running,
And you'd better get Ready to Die.






I never knew Girls existed like you,
But now that I do,
I'd really like to get to know you.


The Girl's too Young,
She don't need any better.
Its all coming back,
Can't you feel it.
The Girl's too Young,
She don't know any better.
Its all coming back,
Can't you feel it.


She is Beautiful,
(She is Beautiful).
She is Beautiful,
(She is Beautiful).
The Girl is Beautiful.

You're giving me moves and hints from all sides,
And when you hit like that you melt my eyes.


The Girl's too Young,
She don't need any better.
Its all coming back,
Can't you feel it.
The Girl's too Young,
She don't know any better.
Its all coming back,
Can't you feel it.

And though I never know you,
I look at your face.
To tell you that I love you,
Don't know what to say.
I give everything I got to the Beautiful Girl,
The Only Thing I live for in the Whole Wide World.


She is Beautiful,
(She is Beautiful).
She is Beautiful,
(She is Beautiful).
The Girl is Beautiful.

I ain't got nothing to lose,
(Nothing to Lose).
gonna throw it away,
and talk to you.

(And it's True) And it's true.
The Girl is Beautiful,
She is Beautiful.
I ain't got nothing to lose,
(Nothing to Lose).
I'm only living one time,
And I want you.
(She looks Good) She looks Good,
(And it's True) And it's true.
The Girl is Beautiful,
She is Beautiful.

You gotta keep up
You gotta keep going...
No you never let down
You gotta keep going
You gotta keep up
You gotta keep going

I went around the place where we once went before
But I never knew it hurt so bad
I wandered back again, but you just slammed the door
I never knew it hurt so bad

We were nothing but kids on top
Never gonna stop
We never let down
We gotta keep up
Keep our heads on 'high'
Never gonna die
'Cos we gotta keep it alive

When you're down on your luck
You gotta do it
'Cos you can't get enough
You gotta do it
You never give up (NO!)
You got to do it
Gotta do all the stuff that you love (no more turning)

When you're down on your luck
You gotta do it
And you're covered in mud
You gotta do it
You still going on (YEAH!)
You got to do it
Gotta do all the stuff that you love

You gotta keep up
You gotta keep going...
No you never let down
You gotta keep going
We gotta keep up
We gotta keep going

But you left me down so many times and took me back
But I'll never turn around again
And now my life is back
I'm back on the track
And I'll never burn it down again, No

'Cos we were nothing but kids on top
Never gonna stop
We never let down
We gotta keep up
Keep our heads on 'high'
Never gonna die
'Cos we gotta keep it alive

When you're down on your luck
You gotta do it
'Cos you can't get enough

ANDREW W.K. LYRICS


Story of life
Story of fate
Something I could've done and now I feel
I've lost myself in time

A picture of those
Beyond control
Hearts messed up, abide,
And so I hear
Spirits weep out loud

Living for my next step
Swinging across the border line
I wanna climb those stairs
And reach the top now

You brought me what I need
Addictive heroin
You sucked my heart, still you want everything
Melting flesh and bone
I don't know what you are
I don't know where I've been
Just look behind and see the shadow
Of a one-day-promisse

Come for a ride
In the kingdom of light
Most of us don't care to sign the deal
When evil hangs around

Heading for my last step
Running across the border line
I wanna stand and stare...

You brought me what I need
Addictive heroin
You sucked my heart, still you want everything
Melting flesh and bone
Whole days and nights in vain
Unplug and mute the pain
These matted eyes now miss the last glare
Of a one-day-promisse


Northern lights dance in the air
Nature paints its scenes
Haunting the winter sky
The wild is so vast,
The air quiet and still
Today a new sun will rise

We’ll be together when the time comes around
We’ll save our prayers and never say farewell
Far becomes close;
Scary, divine
A sudden blaze reveals the course of life

I walk in the night
Counting the stars, in silence
With tears in my eyes
But I’ll never surrender

We’ll be together when the time comes around
We’ll save our prayers and never say farewell
Nothing to fear,
Nowhere to hide
Nobody escapes the course of life


As the universe expands
And high flames are burning
As the light breaks through the haze
And sunrays melt away the snow

The streams get out of control
For we don't own life

It's a fact: we're born to stray
On this deadly journey
We don' know where it begins
And nobody tells where it goes

The wheels just roll down the road
Is there still a chance?

We're alive - that's all we can say
We must stay alert through the night
Side by side, let's keep hand in hand
And wait for the turn of the lights...
The turn of the lights!


Someday I
Will feel enough
To remember
What’s gone
And I will live enough
To be humming
This song

Someday I will
Rejoin your soul
When fire stars
Are falling down on me

Let the clouds
And let the rain
Pour red tears down
Today

Let the heart
And let the pain
Flow away
Away

Feel what is over
Feel what is dead
Your smile forever will live

Like a scar
So many say
It will never fade away
Like a rainbow in the darkest sky

Someday I will be
Together with you
Someday I will leave
This woe behind
For good

Like a scar
So many say
It will never fade away
Like a rainbow in the darkest sky

Someday I will be
Together with you
Someday I will leave
This woe behind
For good


You declare wars in your head
You desert them all instead
Every pulse that pumps your veins
Just reminds you of the weight
All over you...

Simply for a little joy
You neglect and then destroy
The key questions in your mind

When your self-esteem is low
When you find nowhere to go

Stop!... the world can't wait!
You won't find a crystal ball
Throughout the haze

It's about time
To quit that maze
Nothing justifies your pain
For there's no one else to blame


When a shade follows my footsteps at night
That could be you
I descend to the riverside
As I’m staring at the blackened water flow
I sense you getting close
I know you’re getting close

I could reach my hand
And fool my heart one more time
I could stick to what remains…
It’s helpless: our future is behind us!

- You say that you go, you don’t go
And you never leave a choice
- You say that you need, you don’t need
Though there’s urgency in your voice

You’ve been searching for happiness
But emptiness you’ve found

You say that you go
You think you belong - no, you don’t
You’re still living on your own

Is there a future for me?
Is there a hope?
Sometimes illusions, they drown
And dreams are gone with the flood


In the start, light had been made
There were rainbows in the air
In a place we all belong

It’s so curious how it swaps
Like the pieces of a play
It depends on how we stand

Day after day
How we care for each word we say,
Each move we make…

You pretend you’re in control
That you sit so high above
But I prevail without you
When at night you call my name
All your tears roll down in vain
You’re nor unreplaceable

We must stand
Day after day
We must care for each word we say,
Each move we make…


The corporations' jaws
Are spreading all around
Invading like a plague, you can't ignore
You're led into a trap
They even seem to care
About your life, your health - your misery!

They need you to stay
They want you to play
They will find the way into your needs
You're scanned high and low
Cause they want to know:
- Are you plain enough to serve us?

Every time they reach their goals
You're stabbed, but you don't know
Can't you sense the Oversoul?
The meaning of it all...

The blooming of a life
You're innocent and wild
You guess you know the truth but you just don't

That's right when it begins:
You've gotta join that game!
You're looking for respect - to be someone!

They force you to play
They lead you to crave
From now on they'll be behind your needs
You'll do what they say
Can't choose your own way
Right when it's too late to turn back

Every time they reach their goals
You're stabbed, but you don't know
Can't you sense the Oversoul?
The spirit of it all...

Look around and see:
Have you lost all will to live?
Why don't you stand and fight for your soul?


The sight revealed before my eyes
On that very day
A sea of clouds surrounding high
The mountain summit

All so unexpected,
Falling to pieces to the ground

At first I held the shock inside
And then I woke up
I looked around and realized:
The white was red with blood

All so disconnected
When you're striving to survive

I must go...
Over the top, to the summit
Or never know
What lies behind the white giant of snow

Step by step to the summit
I'm face to face with the giant
There's no return...


Unleash the beast you used to be
Let go off, and set it free
Relieve your heart, let it breathe

Forget the place you used to know
Get ready for a miracle
Straightening the curve of the road

From this time, from this day
You'll never be the same
Leave behind what's insane
And let it fade away
You can still count on me
From the past, nothing remains
It's light-years away

When you just listen to the words
From someone who wants to take hold
Of your will, of your thoughts,
Of your mind and soul

People who've lost their own life
Normally try to get by
Inside your world, to lead you on,
They cherish when you fall...


Sometimes I'm sad and lonely
Somedays because I miss you
You held me tight in your arms
As I came out of darkness

Sometimes I watch you go away
I watch you go away...
Hope you don't cry

'Cause in my own stories
I'm ever side by side with you
Somewhere to bind the distance
Somekind of timeless moment

Somewhen I'll let you know
How far you've made me roam
Across the nights,
I hear a train
That won't bring you back
But I'll still wait...

I never really lost you
You never really left me
I feel our hearts as one
Every time I gaze
At the moon

ANDRE MATOS LYRICS


Inspiration
Introspection
Keep on drilling round and round.
Incarnations
Circumspection
Sending shockwaves through the ground

The power got so close to me
Changing my dreams and my hopes
Time to remember the tide will return
Bringing together a storm!

Let it come out and I'm leading on
Just for a while and the stars will burn!
Let it come out and I'm leading on
just for one night and the skies will burn
Oh they'll burn!

Tonight, it descends a new reason
That thunders inside us intensely
Under the moonlight. It's reaching out
And you'll see:
You're making a final decision
Evoking the might and the fury
Drowning together back to Earth's womb...

The power got so close to me
Changing my dreams and my hopes.
Time to remember the tide will return
Bringing together a storm!

Let it come out and I'm leading on
Just for a while and the stars will burn
Let it come out and I'm leading on
Just for one night and the skies will burn oh they'll burn!


And If I tell you that our hearts are free again
You'll know I will return

When you hide yourself away
You know you're pretending
When you shed your feelings
When you let then down

Many times in life we stray
We're seeking an exit
The solitude is leading to a final call

Will you hide in the sea?
Will you lay all your sorrow on me?

And if I tell you that our minds are free again
You'll know I will return

So many stars are lightning up along the way
You'll know I will return
Back forever

I remember the first time
I dream to be over

I believed in demons, I believed in saints
Now we see what we became
The dream was forever

Since we know the path we won't miss match again
I will rise from the sea
I will take you forever in me

And If I tell you that our hearts are free again
You'll know I will return

So many stars are born each in everyday
You know I will return
Back forevermore

The dream was forever
We won't miss match again
I will rise from the sea
I will take you forever in me

And If I tell you that our hearts are free again
You'll know I will return

So many stars are born each in everyday
You know I will return

Back forevermore


Staring at the audience
Your head is a cage
Broken thought fly over
A familiar stage

Gathering the pieces of yourself
That you can't live without
It's only when you became someone else
That you can ease your mind
Always

Heart full of rancour
Has made yourself blue
Enlightened by darkness
The fear becomes true
Kept always pretending
That nothing's been done
If your burn with fire
With fire you'll get burnt!

Gathering the pieces of yourself
That you can't live without
It's only when you become someone else
That you can ease your mind
Always playing a role!

The action was so brilliant
The audience applauds!
You bend down your head and
Deflect any flaws
Inside your heart's freezing
Your mind is a cell
You've swallowed the fire
And fire was your spell

Gathering the pieces of yourself
That you can't live without
It's only when you become someone else
That you can ease your mind
Always playing a role!


Ran away,
In a fragment of despair
From a vicious threat
Such a damage to repair

Finding the truth
Where all have already searched
Is the only way
To fulfill a soul with lust

Lust for revenge
In a world full of sins
Something we're building now
Never figured in dreams

Banal intentions
Mold a personality
needles to mention
Madness and insanity

Lust for a chance
In a world full of wins
What are we searching now
That belong to our dreams?

Shift the night away
Shift the night away
Nothing else could let us fall
We're building up our hopes
We're trusting them again
And suddenly a sign will be found

Shift the night away
Shift the night away
Nothing else could let us fall
We're building up our hopes
We're trusting them again
And suddenly a sign will be found

Make a stand
Start all over
In your inner core
Some day what has caused your suffering
Will reset you back for more

Shift the night away
Shift the night away
Nothing else could let us fall
We're building up our hopes
We're trusting them again
And suddenly a sign will be found
and suddenly a light has been found!


Sometimes you've been searching for a mend
Sometimes you keep hoping instead
But what you don't see
Is the way things turn
Just to remember how far you've gone
Just to remember how far

Hush sweet darling
Rest your head
Keep on dreaming
Beg for more...

somedays seem so fearless
But too soon they're over
It's when all the pain hits back inside
You're tied in your ordinary thoughts
As time goes by...

rest your head
Keep on dreaming so

All over now
Watch overhead
Nothing left but
Some painfull wounds
That won't heal away
Till you can touch all the truth

Hush sweet darling
Raise your head
If you think
That nothing's over yet
Then you need to understand
Every tale has an end!

All over now
Watch overhead
Nothing left but
Some open wounds
That won't heal away
Till you can see all the truth

All over now
Till one day
Life smiles back...
To you!


Transforming what's invisible
To controvert the physical
A blinding ray across the dark
In outerspace
A veils of sparks

The surging particles align
Quantum reaction in the night
Converting matter into light

Hear an S.O.S
Drawn inside the torrent
Fear contains a quest
Now the unbearable unveils

Never think you'd run away or neglect your pain
Primal forces spin around
Magnitude reveals a plan
Anything leads to the edge
Have you ever tried?

Nothing but a state of mind
Just mentalize
Just mentalize

A magic echoes everyday
keeps emanating from the brain
Converting matter into light
The will prevails over the time

Send an S.O.S
Drawn inside the torrent
faith contains a quest
The unbearable unveils

Never think you'd run away or neglect your pain
Primal forces spin around
Magnitude reveals a plan
Anything leads to the edge
Have you ever tried?

Nothing but a state of mind

Never think you'd run away or neglect your pain
Primal forces spin around
Anything leads to the edge
Have you ever tried?

Drawing near
Mentalize!


Among the myriad of green
another grief has been heard today
it flew tearing out again
all the way through the landscapes of light
'till the dawning is killing the night

And how much time will be left
to paint the blue on the firmament
and nothing will be changed
nothing else will resist without care
and the last regret harder to bear

Who said you're invincible
is not at your side now, not at your side now
somedays we're invisible, no one can see us
out in the myriad
your prayers cannot prevent
what's meant to be broken,
it's gotta be broken
it's not just a miracle
consider it a virtue to be caught in the myriad...

You made your way to the light
and now no reason retrocede
but once it starts to burn
feels so useless to capture the fire, oh oh
and nature is ready for war!
awake again it's all inside of you
this feeling has to stand
the coldest winds that freeze and bind you
you're about to see the true face of nature
the selfish won't be spared succumb in the end that's all they search for!

Who said you're invincible
is not at your side now, not at your side now
somedays we're invisible, no one can see us
out in the myriad
your prayers cannot prevent
what's meant to be broken,
it's gotta be broken
it's not just a miracle
consider it a virtue to be caught in the myriad...


It was a day when the sun cried out
it was a moment to burden the doubt
whatever lingers will never reveal
whatever leftover wishes conceal and it's clear

Like the rain:all my fears define who I am
and I hear loud and long, everywhere, a mythical song

Hung in the sky, a lonely star
caught in the twitlight it dances apart
stuck at the gates where the dead stepped
in a subtle hollow spreads out from within and I see

All the way what my eyes could never convey
and it's near,closer now everywhere,a mystical sound

Oh... let me know don't fly away, I'm here
I need to know when will the rain pour down again
coming down over us,washing the past with a smile

To the top of the hill
reach out the sky awake from the dream
now I know we'll fly away
we're free here we go
the falling rain will come again
no matter where or when
it will pour down in the end.


I never thought I feel a whim
slipping through my hands
the morning light comes breaking in
as the blackness fades

No bad reflections can resist
the beginning of an age
a sentence for a crownless king
whose kingdom was a cage

Wonder again why
why should we miss the burning of the flame
wait for another sign of rising disorder
till the blade relieves the pain

Inside your eyes I see a mirror
you mesmerize and there's no error
myself in you to be continued
Inside your eyes I see a mirror of me!

I kept a token of my pleas
carved them into stone
but after sailing open seas
two became one

Wonder again why
why should we cease the spreading of the stain
wait for another sign of rising disorder
till the light 'cause again

Inside your eyes I see a mirror
you mesmerize and there's no error
myself in you to be continued
Inside your eyes I see a mirror of me!


Inside a nest we were born
there we grew up together
you flew away towards the sun
I rather stayed and wondered
why do we fear the storm?
why do we hate and suffer?
inside the heart the mystery lives on
inside the mind,it succumbs!

so, anywhere you go flowing with the stream
have a look inside and see
who in fact we are what you've done so far
with the time you let go

Violence and decadence
tragic routes that cross each other
no one cures the consequence
left behind by violence

Learn from your lessons my friend
and your heart will beat much stronger
for a man who looks out just dreams
but he who looks in awakens!

So, anywhere you go flowing with the stream
stuck within the realms of flesh
all we see is flesh longing for the next
episode of pain cause

Violence and decadence
tragic routes that cross each other
no one cures the consequence
left behind by violence


I've never been
The ordinary man
The world begin
Like every story does my friend

I won't come down
To where i was back then
And nice mirage of love
Has matter single in my heart, my friend

But when the white fog descends
Over the meadows of light
And when the milking way descends
And shatters the meadows of light
It's time to stand up, stand up and walk
Walk all alone, down the same road

I could feel again
Cause i long for the answers lost
And I'd change everything
If i could have a lapse in time

And i could feel again
Before going insane for good
I would change all mistakes of mine
With just a lapse in time


Do you remember, not too long ago
the cherry tree blossomed in vain?
it was so hazy, yet hard to forget
now all seems to happen again

With the power of your mind
no desire is denied

It's a power stream you conceive your dreams
in world you'd never say no
there's a place to go land of miracles
where the feeling never went wrong, no no no no

Time is scare now,you better sleep
forget all the crosses beared
and though you keep on dreaming,your life is for real
all you need to do now is dare

With the power of your mind
every longing can be defined...

It's a power stream you conceive your dreams
in world you'd never say no
there's a place to go land of miracles
where the feeling never went wrong, no no no no




Before the rays of light
Into a fading bright
Riled up by such a thrill again
I just keep still, don't move
The reason can't improve
A scene unfolding in my mind

Into the light I'm falling
Nobody turns to hear cries
Climbing the highest peak of pain
A reason to stay?

Can't stand the pressure of
The pleasures that I bought
They promised I'd be free someday!!
They told me: "Don't despair"
But then now who'd expect
A phantom shadowing my nights

Into the nightmare, running
Somebody, please, set me right
Offer some kindness, no domain
A reason to stay

Oh, waiting for the sun
No wonder why our lives
Were waiting just to run
Don't need you by my side to
hang together on the ropes
Won't you get out of the way?
I've got to go!

Before the coming fight
You need to stay alive
Riled up by such a thrill again!

Into the nightmare, running
Somebody, please, set me right
Offer some kindness, no domain
A reason to stay

Oh, just waiting for the sun
No wonder why our lives
Were waiting just to run
Don't need you by my side
to tell me it's alright, no more...
Won't you get out of the way?
Oh, waiting for the sun...
From this day on, I'm freed forevermore
Don't need you by my side to
hang together on the ropes
Come on, get out of the way
I've got to go!!!

ANDRE MATOS LYRICS









A brand new day at last is born
The first wave breaks on the shore
The sun's shining bright
Across the centuries of pain
My heart is rising again
Did you hear all my cries?

I'm on the edge to turn away
I can't explain
But I don't want to be alone
It's in the air,it's in my face,it's everywhere
I'd like to know how to carry on...

I ask myself in the end:
_Was everybody just lying
Right from the start?
And if you're longing to be free
You better think of a way
To find some love in your heart

I'm on the edge to turn away
I can't explain
But I don't want to be alone
It's in the air,it's in my face,it's everywhere
And now I know how to carry on!

I'm falling with the rain
I'll meet you once again,
Set me free!
I'm flying to ever more
But I won't fly alone
Can't you feel me letting go?

A moment like a million more,
Let me hold it for a while!

Just strangers now or have we met before?
I's up to you to treat me well
Or throw me on the floor
There's a reason why we live and die
In the end only our footprints stay behind...

There's a time for love,a time for pain
Have you seen how pictures melt down
With the sky?

Letting go,letting go...




Sometimes the Universe
Fits inside my world
There's nowhere else to be
And no place to return
The power in my hands
Let law be made by force
At times my conscience speaks
But now it's more and more
The day I'm waiting for...

...Is in the air I breathe
Fine and strong and pure,
Out in the sea beneath,
The mountains and the shore
Inside this picture
A city made by God
Irrational progress
But now it's more and more

Today the skies are blue
I hold the sun tight in my arms...

Rio,falling apart
Someday I will die for you
Never,never give it up
One day I will die for you
In your arms!

I see my universe
Grow larger than before
Maybe it's just because
Nobody cared to shut the door!

I'm locked inside your arms,
The key is in my soul
There is no true scape
So here's where I belong
I look around and see
A city made by God
I used to be free
But now I am no more!

Together we are strong
Let's make the future
Built on dreams!!

Rio falling apart (...)

To play with desire
Is playing with fire
Right from the start!




I see the future coming
I'll tell you what's to be
A life turns into another
But no more I can't see
And I hold your hand

You said you'd never leave him
But now you let him go
Someday he will forgive you
And stop to suffer so
A storm arrives with thunders
The end arrived with smiles
A life inside another
Has made its ways through cries
And I hold your hand
Yes, I hold your hand...

Some days we're covered up in sorrow
But still we're standing here
Sometimes this life's too short
to understand
Someone, oh, please just let me borrow
A little courage for my fears at night...
Don't drift into a state of sadness
Making something never seen
Look under every stone along the way
Whatever happens, use your power,
Don't surrender to your fears at night...

So, turn around,
Keep on moving now
Hitting every single road
Just keeping on running on and on and on...

Running on and on we face our fears
I remember why
And though the dangers run so near,
A rainbow fills the sky
The freedom lies over our heads
We must live before we die
Believe me, I remember why!

There's a way
To melt down your frozen heart
Just keep on living
Cause inside, your will
Never dies! Oh, no!




I'm just trying to find me
I'm just trying to find me

You said I'm too proud to regret it
You never saw how hard it was for me
To take control of my own emotions
To find a way to set myself free
So am I fine to play the role
Of someone long forgotten soul
But what is obvious is that you're so trapped
Inside your own world

Some days I wonder if I could
Be another kind of person,find another truth
I know these words all too well:
By yourself no one else,never break the spell!

How long?
How long will we hide what's going on?
How long will we stand alone?
To see
Whatever lays inside of you and me
It just needs to be unleashed away!

I said now I want to forget it
So many tears have rolled down in vain
And in the end it's just the same
'Cos I know it will never change
I think I never satisfied you
Did you find it somewhere else?
No regrets,just keep on moving
You better trust yourself!

Someday I wonder if I could (...)

I'm just trying to find me...
I'm just trying to find me...




I thought you'd last forever
But like a star,you never would
A stairway on the rainbow
I wish that I knew
Your silhouette surrounds me
I miss the way things used to be
Your voice floats in the wind
How I wish you were here...

Solitude is taking over!
By the way,
So many things I kept from you till now
Stand by me,
Reach out for my hand and I will follow!

Beyond this time I'm living now,
I'm ever looking back at you
And when it rains upon the green fields,
I'll be thinking about you..

Remember how it feels now
You taught me freedom with few words
The beauty of this world was
All pointed by you

Solitude is taking over!
By the way,
So many things I kept from you till now
Stand by me,
Reach out for my hand and I will follow!

Beyond this time I'm leaving now
I'm ever looking back at you
And when it rains upon the green fields,
I'll be thinking about you...

Beyond this time (...)

I knew one day you had to leave me
Still I'll walk on with you...




I decided to come here
To tell you what I never could!
In the end we're not the same,
I'm tired of being misunderstood

All I need is to break free
Like my spirit used to be

Too many nights
I thought of you
But now there's nothing I can do...

Forgive me but I'll say the truth:
It's time to face the end!
What goes around
Comes around back to you,
Forgive me but I'll say the truth...

See the scars deep in your face,
Feel the thorns around your heart
All that's gone now stays behind,
There's no need to fall apart

All I want is to run free
With no shadows over me

So far away
Though standing near
I know these words are hard to hear!

Forgive me but I'll say the truth:
It's time to free the end!
What goes around
Comes around straight to you,
Forgive me but I'll say the truth...

Would you pledge absolution to me now?
Will you throw away your armour?
Or will it go on and on with you?

Forgive me but I'll say the truth...

Forgive me but I'll say it
There's nothing left to stop me
Forgive me but I'm over you!




Falling drops against the window
I took a while to feel awake
Moving clouds is this dream never end
Memories haunt me again
Hear a voice
It sounds like water
Visions make me slip away

All around,the forest growls
While the whispers fill my head
Falling down into a stream of ages
Visions make me slip away

That every day,
I realized the fire burning
Out,as far as I could see
I feel into a silent morning
It's hard to tell,but I say:
Whatever it was,it makes me fear
Invisible for the rest
But I recall it all so clear

These times of joy,these times of wonder
Like a lost edge inside our dreams
It makes me wonder:
What is life,what does it mean?

Rise again,
For your fate will always follow you
No more cries,no hurt and pain
See the future like never before

Undress your sorrow
Leave the past all behind
Time to be free!

Falling drops against the window
I took a while to feel awake
Moving clouds is this dream never ends...

Sounds,they pierce through like an arrow
Hear my voice,it beats like rain
Memories,I'll carry them away...

These times of joy,these time of wonder (...)

Time to be free,give me time to be free...
I need some time to be free




What if you could unlock your dreams?
Could you perceive what they mean?
The nights are clear,the days so dark
But there's a way out there...

Whatever comes into your mind
May be the answers trapped inside
You feel a cold cut through your veins
But there's a way out there...

Alone you go into the darkness

You feel the fear of someone else
A broken picture from the past
The feeling traces in your hands
But there's a way out there...

Alone you go into the darkness

What you're searching for...
Struggling for your sanity
Is knocking at your door...
Dream inside reality!

The more you will find,
The less you will get...
Last tears never cried
Will drown you in the end
You've got nowhere to hide
You've got nothing to give
Who'll rescue now you will to live?

Along your life you never felt on inch of pain
Because you never realized you're still the same!
You ask me why but I'm afraid to let you know
I was your pride that made you fall so far below...

What you're searching for (...)

"The more I could find
The less I could get
Tears never cried
Drowned me in the end
I spread nothing but lies
I had no love to give
Who'll rescue my will to live?"




Life storm broke my anchors
And like a wreek I've been
Sea and sky were just one darkness
Such a brilliant radiance...You came!

I'm alive,I'm alive...
Just by the light from your eyes!

Life storm freed my anchors
Many shores,I've seen
Sea and sky,they gave me shelter
Now we only meet in dreams

I'm alive,I'm alive...
Just by the light from your eyes!

And I need you to be
Like the haven that I seek

But clouds showed me and I saw!
You were just the moonlight...
And the moon belong...To no one!

Suddenly,I stare and see
The light in you still shines on me
Pouring down,endlessly...




The aftermath of disaster
Strikes down to the earth
Time is life's destroyer
A transitional mixing
Commercing us all
As we split forever in two
And the wheels keep turning...

Suspended in time
As you glide through the air
See your body below you
Feelings no longer hurt,
No more fears within
Let me fly together with you
And the wheels keep turning...

Stand forever in the rain
Watch the sun
Break through the sky
If this world has let you down
Take a leap to higher ground
Cause your heart will never die!

Conscience wakes to remind you
The rule of the game
There's no turning back now
You'll became someone else
You perceptions will change
Let me change forever with you
And the wheels keep turning...

Stand forever in the rain (...)

These nights of thunder
Won't come back
Just disappeared
These nights of thunder,so dark
Mode visions become clear!

Endeavour always
Leads so far
Beyond the scene
Endeavour always sows love...
The struggle ends up here!








Here we stand
Worlds apart, hearts broken in two, two, two
Sleepless nights
Losing ground
I'm reaching for you, you, you

Feelin' that it's gone
Can change your mind
If we can't go on
To survive the tide love divides

Someday love will find you
Break those chains that bind you
One night will remind you
How we touched
And went our separate ways
If he ever hurts you
True love won't desert you
You know I still love you
Though we touched
And went our separate ways

Troubled times
Caught between confusions and pain, pain, pain
Distant eyes
Promises we made were in vain, in vain, in vain

If you must go, I wish you love
You'll never walk alone
Take care my love
Miss you love



I still love you girl
I really love you girl
And if he ever hurts you
True love won't desert you
No, No

ANDRE MATOS LYRICS


I'm heading back from years of repressing the thought
How was I wrong pretending to be who I'm not
Feels like being alone too long,
Chasing dreams on my own - I'm coming home

This time around it's perfectly clear in my mind
Along the way -I know what to lose, what to find
Being stranded and lost too long,
Now I'm moving along - I'm coming home


Can't figure out the stuff you're telling me. Whatever, I don't care
Is it another way of showing me what hides behind your stare?
Whatever drives you -I don't wanna know, I saw it all before
I'm moving up and leaving you below, so keep your stupid war

No one remembers when it's all begun, but I won't rack my brain
To understand why every bit of fun you're turning into pain -
I don't know. No matter what you want - I'm checking out, ain't coming back again
I wish you luck - without me around, I got a better plan

Tell me why can't I settle for less,
Tell me why am I running ahead of the rest

Tell me why all this hell of a mess,
Tell me why can't I settle for a little bit less?





Cold. The night is crawling, surrounding every corner of our lives
Wait - somebody's waiting for you to close your eyes...

Sleep. Whole world's asleep. I hear the darkness rising from the deep
Deep, a lake so deep, reflecting every star you've ever seen.
Time flies. Better open up your eyes - you're living in the desperate times

Pain. I'm used to pain, it leads me through the neverending rain
Rain, that heartless rain won't wash my sins and helpless tears away
But I know - now it's time to hold the line

'Coz I'll live, yes I'll live
I'll cross the sea of madness on the wave of disbelief
Countless miles through the lies
A wind of change will take me far away from our desperate times,
Those lonely times

Gone. Forever gone my sense of time, I've lost it on the run
Run, I've always run from everything I've seen an' done
But now... Now it's time to draw the line, time to hold the line

'Coz I'll live, yes I'll live
I'll cross the sea of madness on the wave of disbelief
Countless miles through the lies
A wind of change will take me far away from our desperate days
Faceless days, lonely days
Keep pushing me around and leaving scars across my face
In my eyes our live's a neverending struggle to escape
From our desperate times.


Years of rejections and years of regrets, years of unbearable guilt,
Years of creating a dream life could never fulfill
Days of forgiveness and days of no trust toss me around like a toy
Days which will make me forget even seconds of joy

While pain is cutting like a knife I'm trying hard to reinvent
My life - all my life

Left in a cell with a window so small - barely feeling the sun
Sneaking the light on my skin. But my struggle's begun.
Pushing aside every shadow of fear, lifting myself from the ground,
Throwing the glove in the face of what's holding me down

While pain is working with it's knife I'm trying hard to reinvent
The rest - the bits and pieces of my life.


Sorrow, you are my friend on a day like this
I hope tomorrow will never come to see my tears
I feel the heat's getting closer to me

Shadows are getting darker in my hands
The sun Is fighting to find a brighter shade of gray,
But I'm a man with a mission tonight

I'm painting black on black all over the world
All my future, all your past
I'm fighting colors with a brush as my sword
Through every single day until my last
I'm changing seasons to the state of my soul -
Now you see them, now they're gone
I'm painting black on black all over the world
Znd I won't stop until my work is done.





Wall of fear surrounds you every night, while you're asleep
Pain within won't let you go, won't let you take a deep breath
It's everything - a shelter in your heart,
Last resort of sanity before it falls apart

Leave all your fears, let them rule on the island of tears
Who'll make you stay if you feel like today is the day
To sail away

Rise above your nightmare. You've been down, now make it pay
Step on every piece and let It bleed - now turn away.


Everyday, all night long I keep on wondering 'bout what went wrong
Was I blessed, was I cursed? It doesn't matter, but what made it burst?
Whatever put me down - It hit me hard, you know, so hard
It took my breath away and now it broke my heart

Tell me what turns you on, what makes you drill my every single bone?
Now you win, an' I lost. I waste my time around this evil ghost
Whatever gets you high - it's tearing me apart so hard
But I don't wanna know what made you break my heart

Now I'm turning away. In die end of the day
As I'm looking behind, pass the enemy line
While the smoke disappears - you're alone with your tears,
And a new day's begun, but there's nowhere to run
All your fences are up as they were from the start,
So while I'm moving away, there's only one thing to say:

Doesn't matter who's fault - if you're still standing tall
Or you're falling apart - you can keep a little piece of my heart.

ANDRE ANDERSEN LYRICS


I close my eyes, and let the demons in
To clear my mind from the things that I have seen
On my knees, Father - please leave the crowd
And let me out

I lost my way so many times before
That I forgot just what I'm living for
I'm in the dark, light's so hard to find...
So now I'm leaving it all behind - I'm changing skin

My angry tears like raindrops in the dust
I realized there's no one you can trust
Shot in the back sinking in the night
That's how I'm leaving it all behind - I'm changing skin


I told you once, I told you twice
That you can't live on compromise - but you won't listen
Another time, another place
It's like a neverending race and there's no reason
To waste your life away in one single day

Bridges are burning and chances are few
Man with the scythe - he is coming for you
Stage is the same but some faces are new
Why can't you see that it's over?

I pulled you up, you let me down
I'm sick of dragging you around - it feels like forever
I'm going left, you're going right
Out of my life, out of my sight - it's now or never
Go waste your life away in one single day

Bridges are burning and chances are few
Man with the scythe - he is pointing at you
Stage is the same but some faces are new
Why can't you see that it's over?

Bridges are burning and chances are few
Listen, I'm trying to tell you that
Time's running out, God, but we never knew
Night's getting cold and your story is old - it's been told

I let you in, I turned you loose
I gave you lot's of time to choose to change the story
You are the snake around my hand
The one who used to be my friend - and now you're sorry
I've suffered all the way - you will today
Go, waste your life away in one single day

Bridges are burning and chances are few
Man with the scythe - he is coming for you
Stage is the same but some faces are new
Why can't you see that it's over?

Bridges are burning and chances are few
Waiting is over and this is your cue
Time's running out, God, but you never knew
Listen, I'm trying to tell you


The echo of "goodbye" got poisoned by the lie:
"I'll never let you go"
The shadow of your smile is gone, I wonder why
But now I'll never know
Let the river flow to the place where sorrow grows
No, I just can't let you go!

1000 miles away - can you hear me calling when I see you cry
1000 miles away - wasted days are passing by
You're 1000 miles away

Another day, another place, another scar across my face
At least it's something new
You've disappeared - I'm left behind, about to lose my mind
I had my faith in you
Let the river flow to the place which I will never know
No, I just can't let you go

1000 miles away - can you hear me calling when I see you cry
1000 miles away - wasted days are passing by
1000 miles away - while the sun is shining river's running dry
1000 miles away - I never cared to say goodbye


You can break my heart, you can rape my soul
Tear my life apart, push me until I'll fall
Step by step, day by day, now it's time to break away

Never look back - while you can hear my call
Never look back - until the final curtain'll fall
Never look back - now you can leave it all
Never look back - just leave and never come back

You can tell me lies, you can waste my "bread"
Only in my eyes you're as good a dead
Tear by tear, laugh by laugh, now I think I've had enough


How can I tell what's on my mind right now, while you're leaving
If I could catch you final breath and never stop believing
If I could pray this pain away...

You're in my arms - if I could wish you back
You're in my arms - my world is turning black
You're in my arms - just let me take your pain
You're in my arms - I'm crying out your name

I saw that fear behind your stare, that hope to see tomorrow
It breaks my heart 'cos now you're gone - I wish that I could follow
And make you stay just one more day
I'm going down, someone please help me
Out of this world - nobody hears me
I close my eyes praying for you
But nobody cares even when I do
Scream my head off and cry my wounded heart out
Who gives a damn about one voice in the crown
I'll give everything, even those very few
Days of my life which I have left - to you


I'm walking the streets of blooming despair and regret
Kid in the alley is pressing the gun to his head
Is he right, is he wrong, is he weak, is he strong
Was he fighting alone - on his own?

Rain's falling down and I pray - take all his pain and his sorrow
I wish he could leave it today under the wings of tomorrow
Rain's falling down and I pray - show my the way and I'll follow
Take me and fly me away on the wings of tomorrow

I'm closing the door to the room full of sorrow and rage
Girl in the window in tears sliding over the edge
Is she right, is she wrong, is she weak, is she strong
Was she fighting alone - on her own?

Rain's falling down and I pray - take all her pain and her sorrow
I wish she could leave it today under the wings of tomorrow
Rain's falling down and I pray - show me the way and I'll follow
Take my and fly my away on the wings of tomorrow

Am I right, am I wrong, am I weak, am I strong
Am I fighting alone - on my own?

Rain's falling down and I pray - take all my pain and my sorrow
I wish I could leave it today under the wings of tomorrow
Rain's falling down and I pray - show me the way and I'll follow
Take me and fly me away on the wings of tomorrow




I've been up, I've been down
Bigger stuff couln't kick me around
So you can drop your illusions and hopes
About making me cold

I've been low, I've been high
Tell me, while I was learning to fly
Were you feeding your bitch with the gold paid
For your friends whom you sold?

Can't you understand? I watch your bridges burning
Snake around my hand just bit again

I'm your smile and I'm your tear
I'm your pleasure, I'm your fear
When you're down on the floor
I'm your master, I'm your slave
I'm the one who you've betrayed
Nothing is real and it never will be like before
I'm your freedom, I'm your drug
I'm your shadow in the dark
Nowhere to hide or to run anymore
I'm your shame and I'm your pride
Now I'm leaving you behind
Waiting for my pain to knock on your door

You can roll, you can crowl
I think Biff's kind of said it all
"You're getting rid of the deadly desease
By cutting it right out"
I guess you make your point
Selling friends for the shiny coin
You can cheat, you can lie - can you die
And make your maker proud?




How can I tell what's on my mind right now, while you'releaving
If I could catch you final breath and never stop believing
If I could pray this pain away...

You're in my arms - if I could wish you back
You're in my arms - my world is turning black
You're in my arms - just let me take your pain
You're in my arms - I'm crying out your name

I saw that fear behind your stare, that hope to see tomorrow
It breaks my heart 'cos now you're gone - I wish that I couldfollow
And make you stay just one more day





A black cat moans
When he's burning with the fever
A stray dog howls
When he's lonely in the night
A woman goes crazy
With the thought of retribution
But a man starts weeping
Whe he's sick and tired of life

I keep on dreaming dreams of tomorrow
Feel I'm wasting my time
Lighting candles in the wind
Always taking my chances
On the promise of the future
But a heart full of sorrow
Paints a lonely tapestry

The sun is shining
But it's raining in my heart

No one understands the heartache
No one feels the pain
'Cos no one ever sees the tears
When you're crying in the rain

I can never deny
All the sweet things I have tasted
Tho' I've been mistreated
I keep coming back for more
I know where I'm going
There's no hope of absolution
I can't seem to separate
The good times from the bad

ANDRE ANDERSEN LYRICS




There’s no need to be as wise as Solomon 
To see that world has mired down 
We can’t see the end, can’t see the end 
We are accountable for our actions
The way we choose determines our future

Have you ever thought that it’s not right
To live your life
Without any sort of aspiration
We’re not the ones that you will listen to
But we just wanted to share our experience 
Nobody likes to suffer 
Then why do we make suffer others
It’s not right to make your life go down the drain
Perhaps it would be better to stop and think

It would be better to stop and think
Use your head
Light the torch
A lot of days are ahead and each of them is important
Don’t waste your time it’s going fast
Too many things went wrong
Time is up [x2]
Don’t be the one who doesn’t care
Indifference is like abyss 
It will swallow you
So try to make the right choice


Where is the Garden of Eden?
We search for it
We try to find
We try to grow
What do you think about it?

Break! Broken hopes leave us uncertain
We're walking quite a distant road
To make this all come true
To see the sun, to talk to God,
But we discovered that

Jacob's Ladder breaks!

Erect the monumet to the ideals
Maybe it will soothe you
And maybe not
However act firmly and don't stick to the rules

Resemblance to the experience
Seems to be non-erasable
I do not understand
Whose joke was that

What are we to do now?
Where is our fortune?

This kind of perplexity
Leaves us uncertain
We'll not leave this place
Until we find another one
Another ladder

Keep your eyes open, pals!
Keep your hearts pure!


[feat. Morf from Stanmarsh]Red beams pierce through the sky moving us away from what we have already reached
The place we stand is way too far from where we want it to be
What makes things take an unexpected turn?

Man try to think 
Why don’t you just believe
The good old days
They ain’t no more
The war has become visible
It has touched upon the sore spots of you
We will move ahead just like we did 
Just like we did before

The good thing is
The good thing is we have our heads screwed on right
We’ve got some common sense
But anyway we’re trying to bring everything back

Things will never be the same
Use the hints that sky gives you
The war has become visible
It has touched upon the sore spots of you
We will move ahead just like we did 
Just like we did before

Be honest with yourself
Stop mourning for the past
Pull yourself together 
And join us!


A question has come to my mind
Why do I keep asking myself?
Where are you heading like a tumbleweed?
Like a rock that falls down the cliff?
You are wasting everything!
I find it hard to believe but you’ll always have a chance to turn over a new leaf
We’re stuck between our desires
We’re taking hold of ourselves 
But maybe that’s not the key
That’s simply another deadlock
Another delusion
We fucked up!
What if we’re doomed?
Whaaaaaaaaat?
The outcome is close!
It will show you the truth!
I know that sucks to be kept in the dark!
We’re taking hold of ourselves 
But maybe that’s not the key
That’s simply another deadlock
Another delusion
We are free!
We are free to choose and believe in what we want to believe
And hope that we have one more endeavour! [x3]


I’m full of resolve
I have no strength to mortify my anger
I cannot hold this hate inside
Breaking down 
May damnation take them
I am who I am
They’re just scums! Oh!
Should I calm down?
Or maybe I should just leave them alone?
Or watch them fall into the arms of decay?
They’ll have it coming!
I’m sure that they should not exist 
For heaven’s sake make them disappear
Burn in hell!

Who will restore the balance? [x3]

Is it early days yet for people to live in harmony and without torments?
They say future is in our hands
But why do we feel so helpless then?

Things are waiting for actions from our side
We have to hold our own
I wish we could do more
But future is in mist
Future is in mist
We forge our strength with our own hands
We gotta stick together
And move towards the mist
We hope that our number will grow [x2]


Righteousness! [x2]
I wish the blindfold daughter of Earth could see
What’s happening to her mother
To her mother
I hope I’m wrong and she will reward us according to our deserts
According to our deserts

Accept it gracefully
Too late to be afraid
We’re are ready to sacrifice
We are ready to give out lives to justice
And we’ll do that as soon as she demands
As soon as she demands

(Max, what do you want for dinner? Justice!)

We want justice right here
Right now!
Righteousness! [x2]
I wish the blindfold daughter of Earth could see
What’s happening to her mother
To her mother
I hope I’m wrong and she will reward us according to our deserts
According to our deserts
We’re sick of waiting
Make haste
We need you!


It’s 9 a.m. 
You woke me up to meet a new day
Side by side with you we stand
Striving not to lose the count of days
Not to get stuck in the ruts
Side by side with you we stand
Hardships persist
Side by side with you we stand
Side by side
We will pull through that
I’m with you for bad or worse
Let’s keep these memories in mind to have something
To be proud of
Life is a competition
And we wanna be on top

The winds are getting up
We get stronger everyday
However we’re still so weak
So far from the ideal
Far from the truth

It’s 10 p.m.
Looks like our days have come to an end
Side by side with you we stand
Luckily we didn’t lose the count of days
Didn’t get stuck in the ruts
Side by side with you we stood [x2]

I’m so glad that we went through that together
So many false steps we’ve made
But we may call our lives well-spent
We’ve kept these memories in mind 
We have something
To be proud of
Life was a competition
And we almost reached on top
We almost reached the top


I see these guys every time I walk out of my front door 
I leave my house to get some fresh air
I walk, I see their faces full of arrogance
They crawl, they look like serpents in the grass.

Led by the fashion and false ideas they’re just showing off to piss me off
To piss me off
What in the world does that mean?
Triangles on your shirts
And all-seeing eyes
What the fuck is wrong with you guys?
I am the one who does not believe in this crap
You can’t fill the emptiness with the emptiness
It isn’t even worth trying

I think I will repeat the previous verse again
I see you guys every time I walk out of my front door 
I leave my house to get some fresh air
I hope some day you will head off from the wrong way
Just don’t forget about the things you truly love

Let it be our last attempt to evoke a response from you

You’re not a mirror
You’re not a reflection
So fuck the fashion [x2]

Stick to what you truly love
Don’t forget about the things I’ve said
If you are born to be an eagle
Why are you pretending to be a flying rat? [x2]
Step over that
Don’t be a victim
You are an eagle [x2]


Night brings patience
And lucidity of mind
Am I the only one who is awake?
It seems to me that right now
Things are even more real and clear
To some extent I am filled with darkness
With darkness
I don’t need the sun to be my source of light
Cause I’ve got it inside
I don’t need the moon to be my company
Cause I’ve got it inside
I’ve locked the darkness in the lighthouse
It’s all about keeping it inside and not letting it out
This is what my life turns in
I am filled with darkness and light
I’m a lighthouse
I don’t need the sun to be my source of light
Cause I’ve got it inside
I don’t need the moon to be my company
Cause I’ve got it inside
I give my light to those who are adrift and keep the darkness inside
Cause I am
A lighthouse
I don’t need the sun to be my source of light
Cause I’ve got it inside
I don’t need the moon to be my company
Cause I’ve got it inside

ANDREA GAIL LYRICS


From a dawn in real world to a sunset in the mid
Like the darken reason - depraved. weak. blind
But the age of old wisdom will reconquer the throne
By the force of our bloodrage

We are the new bringers of shattering deletion
Hear the challenge. this is war!
Harrow minded basterds
But the final payment starts

Beyond the gates of mystic reigns
Above a solitary field of crosses
We catch a glimpse of old born light
Through the eye of the seer

I´m laying down. Haunting by a shivered dream of loss
Above my head opens up the blazing darkened sky
But I know too well that whis will not ever taking back
The painful lies surrounding me till the final breach of mine
The gift of foreseeing poisoned every rising wish of hope


Hall a bloodline from our great fathers of the heathen alliance
To the brothers in arms who stand faithful side by side till now

Fight. torn canting perfidy
To renew our true heritage
We must march - Heathen vengeance is rising

Countless aeons of purity awake an unbending pride
For soil and for honor we raise the banners
against the scum of Christian weakness


I´m looking back while the ocean weeps a song
of the wild and everlasting waves on distant shores
What if this ineffable wind will fade and all the glorious lands
I´ve seen eclipse right now

When solid rocks are melting
The oceans boil and unshaken trees combust
No more denial of the omens
When even bells and crosses burst this time

Behind a calm and wide open land
A wall of flames and blackest thunder rise from the dusty ground
What if this mighty tale ends here this day and within the final hour no savior appears

When solid rocks are melting
The oceans boil and unshaken trees combust
No mor denial of the omens
When even bells and crosses burst this time - so let´s raise the flag of decline

ANDRAS LYRICS




With a last croaking gasp, I came to you in darkest hour
Weak limbs, nearly dead, my misty way seemed endless to me

An anguished path in dark bohemian woods
Hope to escape the Miasma track

Hear my words, don't retreat, while others fall I've got salvation
Through the banned mile I crept, hunted by eyes, I surely know too well

My wounded bones haven't failed till now
Against the time that clasped my beloved
Sentenced to death by the fog of deceased
Like a merciless storm of hellish rage

By the life of mine, give me the dear serum
Blessed be thy name, in the coming days of our recovery

In the days of joy, when a cold wind will arise
To scour the land and blow the stench away


Staring with bleak eyes
Behind a pale white face
The cape of sin has bent down their backs

Begged in life and serve in death
Below a wooden cross
Betrayed by the almighty Sign of Christ

When turret clock comes near midnight
The church bell calls for their servants
Among the sad gaze of the dead
Damned to see them all again

Right in the middle
Of this well known crowd
I feel the weakness in every heart

Nearly saying these creatures
Get what they deserve
I recognized we finally must burn
Down the spell of lies and greed
Crush the church and hang these goatfucking Priests

Free the sons and raise
The daughters of our soil
To claim what is ours


The haze above the forests
The crest beyond the dale
Carved in stone by aeons

Pale and mighty glow the mountains
Across a sleeping world
Guarding over endless
Chains of blackened crowns

The wheel of fate has bound us to these valleys
Across those highlands I will walk
The tidal wave will never reach our landscape
Across those highlands I will walk

Saddle the horse and sharpen the blades
The boundaries of conspired pacts
Must stand against the hordes
Drenched in blood, in grimly rage we judge
The scum in front of our walls
Must fall one by one


Lay aside your wearying load
Gathered in dark acreages, far from native land
Close your eyes and suspire
Hear the well-known voices of your brotherhood

By the sight of the hilltops
By the mighty maple trees
In the shadow of the mountain chains
We stand, our blades glare in the sky

Not a twig has lost its charm
Nor reveal its magic since I disappeared
Standing here among these rocks, smell the versant meadows
Truly, I'm home

On my way I counted every day went by
Coming nearer to the hills of my birth
Moving faster as my heart calls to return
Leading me to where I started before


Leaping wolf or a bloodthirsty creature
The shape I couldn't see clear
The eyes black, the claws wide, an uneven fight

Infested

The mutations I realized soon
An unrelenting urge
For blood, for flesh, for the arrival of night




Your path through this woods will lead you to your grave
Spare my soul, we take your sins and bring you guidance
We known our way, the path of our fathers
Sons of god, proclaim your gracious salvation

Through the cold days of ice, while the storm wind whips
The only thing that warms, is the fire made by us.
No god will fir you up, when you shatter on a rock
But the herb behind the stone that cut scars in your bones.

Take your cross and spill your blood to step closer to him.
If we meet again as you say, we may see who has sinned.

Fall astray into an empty space
No Savior and no divine redemption

Desperate cry, fade away in the distance
Leave all behind, your signs of immortality
The wind roams the trees, while flames light up the hill
Silence prevail and soon the pagan path appear


They cross the land from north to south, pass the
Lowfields and escape the marshes.
But on this forest their journey ends,
These hills will stay unbent.

Lay among faithful alliance,
Covered by an unseen hand
To ensure what has been ours since
The day the forests breathe

This path will force you down,
Inevitable, as uncounted times before
You fight, hack, bleed, crawling through
The dust, in the shadow of the wall

ANDRAS LYRICS




Three ravens in the haze of black night
Heralds of a darker force
Surrounding by clouds of fate
Announcers of ruin and death

Other side a grey and black crow
Sentence to death by hearing
The screams from a world beyond
The croak from the depths of the wood

I'm the reincarnated shadow
Of the man I used to be
Riding through me former homeland
In endeavour to set my spirit free


The sjy was clear and calm the night
No clouds hide the stars and no wind roams the trees
When a black stripe appear
High in the sky, terrifyinf and in casket like style
Splitting into two, with hands and spike uncounted and wild
Two riders apper and behind them the armed forces follow

We're the armies of the world, from hell and heaven gates
Fighting for the control over human race
Fighting for your souls
We're marching this endless path since the beginning of time

We are the figures making our moves on the chessboard of life

Painless, ready for the final attack, our blades are strong and sharp
Blood red, the sky turning into a mass grave, no mercy, no prisoners

We're the armies of the world, from hell and heaven gates
Fighting for the control over human race
With swords of divine hate and spikes of hellish rage
Playing our game in this timeless cage




They came from a dark horizon
In the year of the holy war
Bearing swords of blood lust
Unbelieving fools!

Die on the pillory!

We are no mighty warriors
But we fight with sacred words
Our lord cover this hills

Die on the pillory!

You can't hope we forsake this castle
Built on strong beliefs
My cross and cup are witness

Die on the pillory!

Faster and faster you fight
But till now I stand
Soon will be my hour
In union with god

Die on the pillory!

Already the bridge is taken
You beasts will fear my cross
In flames your flesh will burn

Die on the pillory!

Betray of my saviour
I retreat to last edge
My cross as last friend

Die on the pillory!

Never give up faith
Never sway
With my cross I die
In one last fly

Flying in deepest gorge
As times stands still
Flying on divine wings
My final wish


Where are the Warriors
Rested by my trunk
To sharpen their blades
Why didn't they stay on this dark land filled by fray
I see them come and go
Listen to all of you
Who felt my breath of death
Why didn't they stay and becoming a part of it

On stormy, bare hill I found my grave
In the darkest jour, my only voices are rattling chains
Brothers in arms, finalize for what I die
No enemy of us should claim this pass to our land !

So mighty our woods
So powerful the trees
Growing on our soil
Why don't we stay on this dark land filled by fray
I die for defending
My homeland and my roots
It's our greatest gift
Why don't we stay and becoming a part of it

My branches are long
My roots are strong
Standing here for a while to guard our land
Not knowing fear of the pungent wind
Raise your weapons high
Glowing in the sky
To defend the claim, our fathers laid
To protect the miracle of our hills
Raise your weapons high
Glowing in the sky!




Oh, they are coming
In silence they seem passing
The portal to our ancestors

No look behind in sorrow
In honour they are leaving
Knowing, I will follow

So silent are their movements
With pale faces of void
But well-known touch of closeness

Paralyzed by the appearance I stand
Even the smell of death is real
No scream wakes me up from this nightmare

No more quest of time, hour zero
The court is open, certain the sentence

Tonight my destiny will rise from the shadows
Of my doubts
Dead faces point my way
I will follow as they say
Passing the Portal

Follow the child with the cross
Follow the priest and the funeral march

Look in the eyes of your past
Tasting the smell of decay


Wie der felsige Abgrund einer tiefen Schlucht
Wie der höchste Dorn des Berges, unsre Haamit thront

Wie die dunklen Wasser, tief und unberührt
gleichen unsre Herzen unsrer Haamit hier

Im Nebel des Waldes, auf stürmischer Höh
im Innern des Berges ruht der Stolz und die Kraft wie seit je

Asu Stein deine Seele
Aus Erz dein Geblüt
das Wohl unsrer Ahnen - Haamitland


Long ago, the purity of your blood - so clear and unharmed
Renewed my hope for your weak and diseased kind
It's not the death nor the journey that I've came
That makes my hand feels stone cold
Oh no - it's the pain of my past I carry for lives

Want you hear me now, my warning voice
I am the chosen one
To fill your mind with truth and brighten your heart
I am the chosen one

Now that I'm gone, my breath will never return to your halls of despair
To fail again seems to be my destiny and the curse of mortals


1614 - The ground was spoilt
By death bodies
In union they died as they lived
The pestilential fog has spread
His wings of downfall
The wheel of death began to spin

No recreation without transitoriness
No resurrection without the chains of death
In times of despair when all the efforts fade
The strength of blood will rise up from the graves

Here I stand on the graveyard, overcrowded but restless
You can't imagine the smell
Nor regard the forces of the liquid
Dropping from the skull

Drop by drop falls into the sea of sorrow
No saving shore in sight
Welcome to my hell

In the name of the horned
I take this lives to built your throne of bones
And shall I burn in the flames of hell
My powder will find a way to the chosen

Beer and milk from the breats, yeast and blood
Countless waves of grief
Filling up the cup of pain
My altar of retaliation

Drop by drop falls into the sea of sorrow
No saving shore in sight
As I die in flames my curse will live and torment
When drop falling from the skull
Welcome to my hell


1614 - The ground was spoilt

No recreation without transtoriness

In this black hole my live will end
WIth rats as witness, forgotten whore
Never knowing my unborn eyes
The father is far now, he maybe died

Forsake by human, forsake by god
Your birth was painful and your live was short
My final vision reveal my curse
Through deeds I walk till my release

Father I'm back now
From glorious battle
My star shall rise now
But where is my beloved

Last miles my horse flies
Through well known grey hills
In front my castle
But where is my beloved

I came in joyful hope
But now I see dark flages
O tell my father who has reached the arms of death

O son this tragedy is endless
We don't know what we raise
Your loved had end her live
And our seems lost too

Damned are these words
I never want to hear
Damned are you too
And all I'm seeing here
Your soul shall dwell forever
Between these cursed walls
Hearing every day the last beats of her heart

ANDRAS LYRICS






[originally by Sodom]Black metal is the game I play
'cause no one show me the right way
I am a bloody Antichrist, only believe in bad
Spit at the church, Evil I get

Blasphemer...
Rites of death, Return to Hell
I am Satan's child, attack you with Spell

I turn the cross upside down
and read Satanic Bible with fucking grown
my life begins at midnight twelve
masturbate to kill myself

Blasphemer...

I love to drink my own blood
my sin is my life in a war with god
I talk to the demons night tonight
make love and black masses in a dark shadow light

Blasphemer...


Refracted is the silence
When the dark gate is open
And the souls escape from hell
The reek of death and sulphur
Ascend out of the dark
The crys of sacrifice
From the open gate of hell

When the seal and the fire break down
When the forest hold one's tongue
Posses the death and the obtain

Fear in her eyes
When the death comes near
he will steal your soul
Down to pain go away
The quest of deliverance
Is immedialety deceased

ANDRAS LYRICS


People can't predict which one to stand out
If it's hell or if it's heaven it's up to you to pick
All in all, different poles, go with the crowd
Heavenly, hypocrisy, what you gonna swing?

Many of them make it big out of cheating
Humiliate, cannot wait, cut in your turn
In cahoots with others, stick the boot in
But quickly to misery they can return

Easy comes you have a boost
But the chickens come home to roost
For your behavior you have to account

You reap what you sow!

Day by day more make believe they can't see clearly
That what they have can get lost completely
Even then stubborn men keep up this line
Choice been made, who to blame, this is the line

Easy comes you have a boost
But the chickens come home to roost
For your behavior you have to account

You reap what you sow!


Vanished tomorrow
Fire in the sky
I feel the pain
This pain shall last
Corrupted Gods
Crosses will burn
Divine mistake
A dead mankind

Crosses will burn
Burn

Every corner I see
Betrayal, disrespect
Envy, corruption
Unexpected punishment
Our lost souls
Outside our bodies
Without a fate
In the fucking darkness

Wars and conflict
Pestilence, disease
Infesting the Earth
Crosses shall burn

Vanished tomorrow
Fire in the sky
I feel the pain
This pain shall last
Corrupted Gods
Crosses will burn
Divine mistake
A dead mankind

Wars and conflict
Pestilence, disease
Infesting the Earth
Crosses shall burn

"A dead mankind
Infesting the Earth
Divine mistake
Crosses shall burn"


In the eyes of the killer they stand
In the vision of the murderer they shall die
Insane dreams, fucking nightmare of thousand deaths
In the eyes of the killer they stand

In his plains, in his aim, they stand
They become these new victims of his madness
Psychotic eyes of the one who shall kill
Every one who believes in a god

In the eyes of the killer!!

In his life there has left a pleasure to kill
In their life death becomes the next door
Eyes of fire, certain strength made of steel
And they become only victims of his will

In the eyes of the killer!!


I don't believe in you
Fuck off what you're gonna do
Your truth is a lie
I'm gonna shoot your eyes
What do you represent?
Who are your friends?

Fuck you
You mean shit
Fuck you
You mean shit

You make me sick
You make me shit
You make me laugh
You mean hypocrisy

I don't trust you
Call me what you want and fuck you
Your life is a lie
You should open your eyes
What do you represent?
Who are your friends?

Fuck you
You mean shit
Fuck you
You mean shit

You make me sick
You make me shit
You make me laugh
You mean hypocrisy


Revolt inside the walls
Revolt with no end
I must kill them all
No one shall stand
Unleashing all anger
Unleashing all pain
I'm the coldest murder
He escapes in vain

This time there's no choice
This time there's no escape for them
This time we win and celebrate
This time the last enemy won't stand

Die, die
I'll watch you bleeding
Die, die
I'll watch you begging
Die, die
I'll watch you suffering
Die, die
Yes, I'll watch you dying



So long we've waited
To take this power
So long we've watched
This rising empire
This time for revolt
This time for war
They beg for mercy
We claim for more

This time there's no choice
This time there's no escape for them
This time we win and celebrate
This time the last enemy won't stand

Die, die
I'll watch you bleeding
Die, die
I'll watch you begging
Die, die
I'll watch you suffering
Die, die
Yes, I'll watch you dying

Revolt inside the walls
Revolt with no end
I must kill them all
No one shall stand
Unleashing all anger
Unleashing all pain
The killing is complete
Even you won't stand

This time there's no choice
This time there's no escape for them
This time we win and celebrate
This time the last enemy won't stand


Blind
Blind but not dead
Blind but still breathing
Blind but alive
Blinder
Those one already dead
When strength is over
Blind leads the blind

Dead
This time they're all dead
For I am the one who leads the blind

When strength is over
Blind leads the blind

Corruption
Poison of mankind
Endless corruption
Kingdom of the blind
Lambs with no sight
Kingdom of the blind
Lambs with no sight
Blind leads the blind
God's creation
Lambs with no sight
Kingdom of the blind
Blind leads the blind
Ways of perversion
Ways of death and crime
Blind leads the blind
Blind leads the blind

Dead
This time they're all dead
For I am the one who leads the blind

When strength is over
Blind leads the blind


I'm gonna destroy your life
Your soul, your body, your mind
You are a motherfucker and ignorant
I've got the power in my hands

Now it's time for war, not time for peace
Now it's time for war, not time for peace

I'm gonna look in your eyes
Before you fall at my side
You are a loser and coward
Don't try to escape from your life
This is your reality

My hate
Your fear
My hate

My words against your lies
Your lies against my mind
My hate against your pride
My hate will never die

I'm gonna destroy your life
Your soul, your body, your mind
You are a motherfucker and ignorant
I've got the power in my hands

Now it's time for war, not time for peace
Now it's time for war, not time for peace

I'm gonna look in your eyes
Before you fall at my side
You are a loser and coward
Don't try to escape from your life

My words against your lies
Your lies against my mind
My hate against your pride
My hate will never die

This is your reality!!


Born in an age of war
Raised just to kill
Born in a an age of fear
Raised just to die

Hate invades our veins
Just like a poison invades your mouth
Hate invades our brains
Just like a poison invades your body

No compromise
No compromise

Born in an age of terror
Raised just to win
Born in an age of panic
Raised just to suffer

We are dynamite
We are dynamite
Dynamite, dynamite

Hate invades our veins
Just like a poison invades your mouth
Hate invades our brains
Just like a poison invades your body

No compromise
No compromise

We are dynamite
We are dynamite
Dynamite, dynamite


The old legend is back
The fate is coming
Violent and fast destroying and fucking
Just like a guillotine is your neck

Your life is rotting
Your soul is bleeding
Global decadence, fatal vengeance
Natural holocaust, Earth in suicide

Degradation
Annihilation
Devastation
Over population

The old legend is back
The fate is coming
Violent and fast destroying and fucking
Just like a guillotine is your neck

Degradation
Annihilation
Devastation
Over population


You may think you already killed me
You take care with these things that you think
You should look at your back sometimes
You will find all those ones your left behind
You forgot that you left me bleeding to death
You forgot that you shoot me a hundred times
But you should have waited longer to see
That death didn't want to bring me

Not dead yet
Not dead yet

Your should start to think about running away
You should keep your eyes opened night and day
Now it's time for me to be the hunter
Now it's time for me to be the killer
Should I call you now a victim
Should I call you now a prey
There's no turning point this time, my friend
You are a dead man anyway

Not dead yet
Not dead yet


No fate, no fear, no hope
From pain, from dust, from blood
No chance, no fake, no lie
From dark, from hate, from fight

No trust, no judge, no fuck
From crime, from rage, from force
No shame, no pride, no rise
From Evil, from fire, from high

Let's kill again
Let's kill them all

Chaos and riot
Down the liars
Chaos and riot
Down the liars

Betrayer, full of lies
Betrayer, I see your fucking life

No fate, no fear, no hope
From pain, from dust, from blood
No chance, no fake, no lie
From dark, from hate, from fight

No trust, no judge, no fuck
From crime, from rage, from force
No shame, no pride, no rise
From Evil, from fire, from high

Let's kill again
Let's kill them all

Chaos and riot
Down the liars
Chaos and riot
Down the liars

Betrayer, full of lies
Betrayer, I see your fucking life


Behind these walls
Rottenness reigns unique
The seeds of hate
Arise all the time
Hostility
Reigns more and more
This is a cancer
With no cure

The machine
Commands poverty
In a dead
And archaic world
Ignorance
Got spread in the masses
As the flames
Burn in the ashes

Behind these walls
Rottenness reigns unique
The seeds of hate
Arise all the time
Hostility
Reigns more and more
This is a cancer
With no cure

Rage empire

You can't hesitate
Not able to know
Life emergency
Forever calamity
Deathbed image
is empty on your mind
Fear leads the world
Stopping crowd's spite

Scaring people means
Limits of time
From the inner trauma
The will to feel high
Getting along with
Advices of ghosts
Adrenaline in vein
All my prayers were sold
Fear is my ally

(Welcome to the haunted)
Anywhere I go, a stain is in my brain
I was made to keep my mouth sewed
I learnt to forget the contesting speech
although I know the things I have to skip

Poverty domination, religion control
There's no medicine
Please, scream for me
Day after day, panic overhead
Comma is my shelter
Future is my past

Fear is my ally


The human instinct says to kill innocents
In the middle of hell
Everybody remains
Shoot against the wall
Non-expression power
From world's TV
Come up faking cowards
Down the jokers
Fun is mike a mess
When involves misconception
Masters of politics
were born through deceptions
Through the lying fact
my eyes get blind
Revenge, destruction, fucking suicide
Money moves the world
The unfair competition
I'm searching - It's disgusting
War downtown
Kill the ancient lying at all
Trust in a worth future
Calm down the cursed culture
Shocked crowd - Manipulation
Distorted visions of hunger in this land
Revolt myself to take jokers away
Don't feed my hope
Forget conditions
Rebellion will come
It's up to the people


I am coming fast to face up, kill !
Reviving confusion on past days
In front of my eyes, time stands still
Envy, you will lose the human race
Cells are dead and your brain
needs a morgue
Try to innovate, damage and enslave
All your traps are premeditated
Even the worst, it wont be enough
A tied straitjacket, rush!
In vain, the hate in vain, invades,,,
Remind the last time I stopped your rage
Trembling legs, I'll defeat you again
This is the proof I bother you
Stabbing when I turn back
makes you a fool


Earth is rotten - inside its own beliefs
Imprisoned - rules control, bullshit
Brainwashing - no more euphoria
Obsolete Life - panic and phobia
The age of rage
Smell of red - ideas left
Still surviving - comes infected
Hostage - future's guessing
Haggard - the fire's blessing
Follow all kind of hate in you
Massacre from now
I'm an outlaw
Don't try to scream
They can't hear you
See that image again,
So I say fuck you
We will do the invasion
for the lord of desperation
Surrounded by ignorance
Missing a chance


Black clouds are confusing closed eyes
Tell me about your day of tomorrow
A pillow of stone, fire on bed
Inside twilight, true nightwares
And you woke up dead
Reality is bad
Going to nowhere
Wake up from your terrible imagination
Blow against the flames
that give you scars
Like a puppet on an evil scythe
Crawl to hell's gate
Don't change your mind
Falling into an abyss
Disgrace reminds of premonition
Victim of the night, demolition
Answers were given, no return
Sorrow, excuses, it doesn't work
Invaded by infectors in your blood
to kill you slowly
Enigma of an old cursed prophecy
to be discovered
Eternal punishment
To the slavery I give my hands


Rests of chemical trash - boiling shit
Leading population to insanity
Gutter exceeds all capacity
Wasting food - my reality
Piles of dead bodies below my steps
Pure disgrace, evil comes fast
What can I do, what can I see
I just wanna breathe
Society decays
Where are the opportunities?
Everlasting rain - apocalypse
Heavy traffic, crash - no surgery
Assault, education - disparity
The developed underground is rich
Dirty black light, scream of silent night
Corruption faces,
No more patience


Why? I can feel someone is
following me
Why? I can see the thin line
of panic and sanity
Out of my head, I wake up in desperation
From outside, certain death is a destination
There are shadows in my soul
Madness I cannot control
My body like time-bomb
A ll my forces fucking strong
Look at my face, mess the war,
Make your choice
Let me see, your free hands, the agony
My decision even right is crucified
My only world is a night to satisfy
Why? Everytime I need to kill I wanna die?
Inside the room, four walls
the only friends of mine


Countries government speak
about the arsenal
Taking fear and provoking the start
of a new big war
Eliminating rates of charges
and leader marks
Discussion forces showing
the conditions to decide
Fighting words - toleration
Fatal words - negotiation
Non-shooting war
Curiosity, invisible bombs of cruelty
Technology towards your head, look up
your eyes I cannot see
guns are under masks, attack
Increasing economy, kill or not
It doesn't matter
I'm sacred by this shit
Every moment the aim
selects a great alarm
The army is waiting for permission
to depart
The legend of pressing buttom
to destroy'em all
Silly demagogy
A bitter taste in my mouth
Cold memories...


War against the power domination
My country is a future salvation
Patriarchs don't bleed anymore
See what we could offer to all
Total respect - Protectionism
T he trading market
S.O.B.
We don't live in a jungle
This world's doesn't means Holocaust
If you want my name is worm
If you need I say fuck off
Chaos, a civil war
No timeline anymore
Promise, action done
Solution, dollars burn
Rise up the flag, united nation
Bastards, forever abomination
Illusions, believing in equality
Elimination of humanity


Atomic bomb, dynamite,
men on the moon
Science for health,
science for every mood
Terror communication
Nobel prizes are my mutilation
Chemical gun in the air and inside letters
Show me the cure to cancer
Challenge never ended
Show me the cure to cancer
Challenge has to be ended
What's your choice? What's your chance?
Anesthesia
Like a Russian roulette
disturbing overseas
Risk of scientific creation
UNO agreement violation





Claustrophobia,
walls coming to crush you
Innovation, fear
tendencies to disappear
height, many floors, the hallucination
Psychology, I need your dedication
Shiver, crowd, changes, outside
Depression, the blood starts to flow
Panic syndrome never know
Remove a nail from my soul
I cant's stand this pain again
My only game got a checkmate
Skeleton warms up
and bones start to break
You faint and fall
Evoke spirits to conquer the new level
Forget the law

ANDRALLS LYRICS


Death became a past way 
A dead world has gone away 
My eyes can bring the real pain 
This fever blocks my way to say 

In memory of creation 
For all a survival subject 
My soul as condemnation 
Internal conflict as a crime 

I decided to resist 
Please man don't spit on me 
I can suffer living here 
In this fucking misery 

Beyond the chaos 
The peace for chaos 

Fear, pain, scream 
Fire, terror, chaos, destruction


Final countdown 
Coming near 
Greed in world hands 
Increases on you 

Laws by power 
Their dome 
Faking as a man 
I am this one 

Rotten money 
The jail test 

Politicians 
Poor ideas 
Think about these lies 
Force against mind 

Evident riot 
More and more 
Corruption fails 
Face up, we have the force


How can you see? 
You don't agree, reality 
How can you dream for a peace  
in human minds? 
How can you die? 
A dead heart, it's fucking time 
How can you be in liberty 
and keep on alive? 

Scenes of misery are put in your eyes 
What's the price of burning in rage time? 
Lucky is a part of keeping alive 
No difference between shit and mankind 

Scream, the agony of the end 
Save the demise of sick bodies 
They don't wanna rest in grave 
Unhappy soul salvation 

Death increase 
My mind decays 
No way to escape 
Don't be afraid 
What a shame!


Our tomorrow's day 
What are we gonna say? 
Learning with mistakes 
It can be late 

We don't realize 
The hard way of life 
Revolution's deal 
Destruction is real 

We see crime 
We can't fight 

The return to the fury, overtime 
The return to the thrash blood's mine 

See what you're looking for 
Where is brutality? 
Peace in a dead world 
Win all your enemies


Echoes you listen and your eyes can see nobody 
Angels and devils are telling the sad story 
Desperate prayer for staying in purgatory 
No matter how was your life of  
fucking glory 

There's no sight, darkest night 
Eyes are blind 
Kill the beast, my legs will slack 
I kneew down 

Andralls - Burning Tower 
Andralls - Flames Devour 

You rest on a bed 
Your mind is not in peace 
Sins in discussion 
You are feeling sick 

Dead souls are laughing and you cannot touch their skin 
Eternal suferring hoping for pardon of sins 
Questions of living are asked  
to be kept alive 
The chance was given 
Now you can open your eyes


Your life is lost 
You could deny the death 
The mind scares 
You think you are the best 

Pray for your soul 
Blood purify 
The whishing course is always  
at your side 
Live the immortal life 
Deep to glorify 

There's not a salvation, false pray 
Another hard crucifixon, dead faith 
This is the last temptation, awake 
Suffering the pressure 

Feel ending sigh 
Agony is mine 
Cremating all ideas you will die 
Mist eternity 
Faith oppression 
Now way to escape from condemnation


Children asking for money 
Being out of control 
Forget the suffering pain 
And killing visions they feel everyday 

Dispersed on the ground 
They can see bodies dying all around 
It's turning day into night 
And preserving sickness in this end of times 

Cocaine, I wanna sniff, I wanna kill 
I want the hell, the blood spills 
The drug is my only deal


Who has never felt fear in the life overcoming what's near? 
Fight for your dreams 
The solution is to face and speed up the evolution

Destroy the scar 
Taste of sorrow attacks 

Dark pale shade 
You can see nothing 
Death is calling 

Last warning safe exposed 
And the guilt can belong to the force 
Life, very short 
You have never been late to fuck all around


The religion system, technology 
The cross nowadays, human apology 
Advanced future, mind intelligence 
Exploring all the possible discovered 
hidden senses 

So Many Gods 

Dead by crimes, decide 
Dead by crimes, don't mind 

Stop the evolution, burn me alive 
Transforming all the world, the world is a lie 
Sickness is coming 
Greed in liberty 
Miracle salvation for eternal destiny


Old spirits have met again 
The presage brings the whole will 
for winning 
Happiness and violence 
Side by side 
Terrible battles 
Another city to destroy 

A mission to be done 
Now glorification 
A long way to run 
For another new hurt battle 

Reunion, terror flash-back 
A lot of critical mass 
Waiting for massacre 
We're here for "fasthrash" 

Back from nowhere 
We have never gone out there 

Screams and tension 
and desire to win 
General violence 
Helping spirits around 

Never think in the end 
Think twice when you say 
Your mind commands your soul 
Don't let your body feel it's alone


In the year of a new century and nine months 
From the sky will come a great king of terror 
The sky will burn at forty-five degrees 
Fire approaches the great new city 
In the city of God there will be a great thunder 

Two brothers torn apart by chaos 
While the fortress endures 
The great leader will succumb 

The third big war will begin when the big city is burning 
(Nostradamus 1654) 

This desire in order to deny the pain 
The will for destruction no more in vain 
In the new century, peace season 
Not war even with a reason 
Mind is weak and force makes death 

This land is living on the edge 
Against myself war in my head 
To organize all this mess 
We hope the leader will succumb for stop using the shot gun 
The time, only when you want

ANDRALLS LYRICS


Alone, running with hate
Searching the choices
Sick, desperate
Depression is yours

Alone, running the world
Escaping from lies
The story is old
Is the true hard?

Look at your face
It makes me sick
Words from your mouth
Makes me want to puke

die, die, die, die
Lie, pain, towards you
Alive in vain, deny the proof


Open your eyes
Look at the chaotic world
That is spinning around you
War grows all over the world

Massacre, Corruption, Destruction

Dont be quiet, fight !
What do you expect from your future?

Men and women are been killed
Children dying of hunger
And people are watching this
without doing anything like
nothing is going on

Justice for all

Nuclear weapons
are destroying animals
This is a perfect destruction


Look into the mirror
There's another world
Pass through the window
Tell me which way to go

You can never stop it
Got a a way to top it
No more mystery

Show me your aggression
Afraid to learn the lesson
The guide you'll need

Run to the holy place
You won't see disgrace
But shadows in the sky

Play, together to the end
Life is just a game
Never fear to die

Back to where you live
There you'll be alone
What a waste of shit
They that could be wrong


Live in constant alert
Feel the fear to every moment
Try to escape from total destruction
It's up to you, to find the solution

Try to smile even with sadness
To fight without knowing who attack
As we dive deep into the madness
Our minds and souls
They're getting black

And you must decide
How is the future of life?
Don't cry, you have to try
Remain your soul being divine
And you must decide

If people have some time
To be hide or get arise
If not, you will die


When you think about the past
Salvation had been burned
Remember you were not fast
To get death's overcome

Endless pain, collective suicide
Fire in me, fire in my life
Realize you were not blind
Weep and wait for your rite

In the middle of disgrace
Run away, save your side
Helpless, let's make our trace
Blood, salvation my mind

Andralls - Burning Tower
Andralls - Flames devour

This pain was a fact of time
In my heart I have no pride
To live here I'd rather die
And the worst, it was my life

Nothing to pray, nothing to trust
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust
Hear the screams
There's no more dreams
I will not win


Nothing else, what I feel
By the fire of the sunset
Life is between ground and sky
The solution, I can't find

It's fading like closing my eyes
I pray before I die
An exit is not to cry
When my time to arrive

The moon at midnight
Reflect on my sight

Duel and get the heaven
I have no chance to escape

My soul dominated for fools
Don't push, don't break the rules

One star will born this night
What's the secret of the life
It's fading like closing my eyes
I pray before I die

Run away and find the infinite
The believers may achieve


Maybe my hope is over
It's far away again from me
Destruction around the world
I'm dying of the same way

See it in the loneliness
Sadness brings the tears
Without another choice
Scared by my fears

Turn off the lights
When you ask the time
You don't wanna know
What the evil has to show

Behind the light

In the night shadows I see
Ghost stories become true
Spirits flying around me
Caution is the word for you


I am the frontman
I am the death angel
I come from apocalyptic past
I come back, so it was written

I come bringing my silver bird
and when I fly down
I pour out bombs on you
Good and Bad - Dying
Fuck off - This is my mission

Fire in hell, fire in the sky
Fire in your mind, fury in your eyes

I was the envoy of God
to destroy this shit at all
You had another chance
And they wasted again

Now you're stupid humans
I pour out the fury on you
Their advanced technology
Their guns, their shields, nothing

I come from apocalyptic past
I come back, so it was written


People around you
and the fear of losing your life
Pain wraps your soul,
Lady death will appear from the night
Fear of the death
while your body is destroyed on a bed
heaven is your hope
but hell is what waits you instead

It stole my life
It stole my soul
It came as my lady death

My rotten mind, blood stops to flow
Together decomposed rests

Black Mantle spills all the blood
And ou can't feel the blow
Death let me rest,
this desease is consuming my soul
Discord schyte, you wont get me even
with a trap
After this pain there's always time for
paying back

The time is passing, swearing and belessing,
you try to reach out for peace
Whatever you do, whatever you say
It's coming for you and for me

Hate, disgrace, rotten minds
your life ends, save your cries
Lady death, burning soul
Dying day, you don't know

From this day on
Your soul will burn in hell
You don't know
I won't tell

As life ends
You lie, you pay the price
Regretting
You lose, you die


That's my life,
Shows the world my fury
That's my life
Shows the world how it is
The truth is ugly and must be said
That's my life,
Shows the world its face
War, chaos and death
My mind needs attack

ANDRALLS LYRICS


Can you hear my silent screams?
Can't you see I'm screaming out your name?

From here where I stand
It's all so clear to me
Now I can see myself drowning into tears
Echoes screaming inside my head
There's no one to take and to hold my hand

There where I stood I thought I could never fail
All my desires drove me insane
I was not prepared to lose that fight against myself

I see through you beyond your eyes
I'm flying with my broken wings
I'm looking for the one I am
There's still time to open up my eyes and realize

Mirror I'm calling you, show me my cold face
Look in my eyes, show me the reasons
Tell my why!

And now I wanna know where my life could go
Heaven or hell,
Evil or angel,
I don't know...

I see through you beyond your eyes
I'm flying with my broken wings
I'm looking fot the one I am
There's still time to open up my eyes and realize
I see through you beyond your eyes
I'm flying with my broken wings
I'm looking for the one I am
There's still time to open up my eyes and realize:
"There's life inside!"


Breath the smoke feeling the hate
Standing on fire burning my soul
Lock the chains bind my spirit
Breath the smoke feeling the hate

I can't carry on any longer
Living among the walking undead and their rotten souls

Look in the eyes there is no soul
Just a collective hiterical mind
That rules us all

Look around, look around,
Look around and what you see?

Living undead everyday
(Try to speak with zombies)
This is such a waste of time
All I need is to break free now
Living undead everyday
(Living undead everyday)
Among concret souls and I feel the cold
It's driving me insane!!!

Breath the smoke feeling the hate
Standing on fire burning my soul
Lock the chains and bind my spirit
Breath the smoke feeling the hate

I need to be released now!!!

Living undead everyday
(Living undead everyday)
This is such a waste of time
All I need is to break free now!!
Living undead everyday
(Living undead everyday)
Among concret souls and I feel the cold
It's driving me insane!!!

Everybody has no soul
I can see no brighter eyes
They have just faded away
Faded away, faded away...

Look at the gray sky who stands above us
All it's heavy weight reflects in my voice
Humanity covered in concret marches on
With incoherence reaches a new day

Light of a new day seems to never to come
Our lives seem to be in loop undone
When will come a day for us to wake up
It's too late now there's no turning back!!!


What's going on?
Unnamed feeling are emerging
It's like waking up from a dream
In which lucidity kisses madness on the lips

Instincts crawl under skin
Dominate my senses
I can't believe it!
What have I become?

Something unnamed drains my heart everyday!

Shadows come from light
Pain from the love
Tears from despair
Inside four walls
Mascarate the sin of love
And draining our innocence
The petals go away
The torns stay
I can hear my soul screaming
Draining my heart
Draining my heart
Draining my heart again...

Something unnamed drains my heart everyday...

I can't sleep tonight
These "Me's" are waiting for the absence of light
They want to go through my cold skin
Break my mind's barries, take this life from me!

My smile was taken by routine
With beautiful memories
I can't believe it
What's going on with me?

Something unnamed takes aways "part of me everyday"!

Shadows come from light
Pain from the love
Tears from despair
Inside four walls
Mascarate the sin of love
And draining our innocence
The petals go away
The torns stay
I can hear my soul screaming
Draining my heart
Draining my heart
Draining my heart again...

Much feelings, but no sense
Bird of a prey, without high flights
The empty fills me up
The dawn is in mourning
It's just life dying...
...that's how I feel

Shadows come from light
Pain from the love
Tears from despair
Inside four walls
Mascarate the sin of love
And draining our innocence
The petals go away
The torns stay
I can hear my soul screaming
Draining my heart
Draining my heart
Draining my heart again...


Proving my hate inside of a apocalyptic chaos
Facing the evil that doesn't show his face

Evil power
Keeping hopes
Faking reasons
Hidding on the shadows of god
Through eternal lies seeking salvation
Fobidden roads meeting the hug of pain
A lake of tears where history ends
Eternal fantasy, eternal tragedy

Welcome the land where sun is born without life
Creating hate blood sprouting on the promisse land

The gold lights dim the justices eyes
You keep millions of blind souls seeking for the light
Creating your shadows creating your kingdom murder of dawn
Selling us the cure

Through eternal lies seeking salvation
Forbidden roads meeting the hug of pain
A lake of tears where history ends
Eternal fantasy, eternal tragedy

"Behind the sun is my place, oh, my freedom, my salvation"

It's terrify,
The evil minded spreads it's seeds inside our hearts
We're on our knees to the grace of false rescuer
Pay the price or die

Through the ashes, through eternal life - shadowmaker
Through the ashes, through eternal life - shadowmaker
Through the ashes, through eternal life - shadowmaker
Through the ashes, through eternal life - shadowmaker

Through eternal lies seeking salvation
Forbidden roads meeting the hug of pain
Surrender when life is fading away
Eternal fantasy, eternal tragedy!


"I woke up early in this morning
Lost and confused whitin' this mess I've made"

I'm here trying to find reasons who made me fall
And why I had to crawl
I've never tought I could get this far
I've never saw you crying eyes
Now I'm drowning in you lake of tears

I want you to know who I am
A simple man who made his own mistakes

Here I am, alone in my harvest of sorrows
The breeze on my face will break the ice around my heart
So here I stand, behind my eyes my soul starts to cry
I know it's all for choice I've never made

That's how I feel

I've tried to do all the thing on my own
I tought I was strong enough for
But my way was divided in two
I didn't know which path to go to
Who's never made mistakes tell me
Where's the man that I used to be
Who's this one who lives inside of me?
How long will the rain fall over my head?

For all those thing's I've made
I will have to take this pain with me

Here I am, alone in my harvest of sorrows
The breeze on my face will break the ice around my heart
So here I stand, behind my eyes my soul starts to cry
I know it's all for choice I've never made

Here I am, alone in my harvest of sorrows
The breeze on my face will break the ice around my heart
So here I stand, behind my eyes my soul starts to cry
I know it's all for choice I've never made

Here I am, alone in my harvest of sorrows
The breeze on my face will break the ice around my heart
So here I stand, behind my eyes my soul starts to cry
I know it's all for choice I've never made


It's just anotyher day
But I've still got the same questions
I think this quest for myself will go on forever

I'm tired of this never-ending blues
It's time to put some colors back to my life

I see the world through my stoned and crying eyes
Everytime I hold my face I feel my skin is cold
I search for the sun to shed it'd light on me
I see no light there, I feel no life in me...

I know it's all just the way I see the life
Show me the way to believe again!!

The light will warm me and make me open my eyes
So I'll see that I could be... Alive again!!!
It's hard way to realize life still goes on
I don't know how to run from this state of mind!

I'm tire of this never-ending blues
I'm lost and alone, in Company Of Silence

I see the world through my stoned and crying eyes
Everytime I hold my face I feel my skin is cold
I search for the sun to shed it'd light on me
I see no light there, I feel no life in me!


You're leaving this simple life in which you lived a step behind yourself
Besides the living shadows a destiny you cannot escape

A strange voice surrounds you
Scenes of horror inside your head
Madness wals beside you
Through roads of despair

Tonight you'll see
Through me you'll come to live
No pain, no fear
Scars won't appear after a dream
Closed your eyes on the mirror
Secrets under lock and key

Besides the obvious!
Besides the living shadows!
Kill the locked face off in your mind!
Because it conspires against your extinction!

"Everyday we walk through the same streets
We live like ghost, meeting disposable faces
In this dull metropolis
We meet a bed of roses in an oceans of lies
And that's that we call... living"

Pain and sorrow are too much
I live in anguish and times going by
You took my paradise
I'm without a soul, without you, blurred in sin
The flame that warmed us, now is burning
Cause I can't feel it!
I can't escape from myself
No scared wounds take me inside
All the time I cry
All the time I bleed
All the time they lie
All the time I die
You gotta believe me
'Cause all the things I say come from inside...
...from my heart, my mind and my soul

"And everytime I felt your pain, and I know how much it hurts
It's been hurting your soul, so as mine secrets in the mirror, the lock and the
keys are inside you"

"Wait! Leave me alone! I'm going mad!
I hate you!
I'm tired of hearing this voice!"

"I feel your pain, your love and your anger!!
Do you trust me?"

"I'll trust you!"

"Come on!"

Everything that hurts you
(Everything that hurts you)
Everything is out control
(Everything is out control)
Those things won't leave your mind
(Those things won't leave your mind)
They took away your bright eyes
Some other face controls you inside

Tonight you'll see
Through me you'll come to live
No pain, no fear
Scars won't appear after a dream
Closed your eyes on the mirror
Secrets under lock and key


I can see inside your eyes
All the things that you keep inside
You can tell me all your lies
And all the ones that you've left behind
You cannot see me, but I'm real
I've been here to see what you do
And when you walk by on that wrong road
It's time to make your heart burn

And now I'm here, I cannot sleep
I'm tired of this voice echoes inside my mind
I'm trying to break free, and I'm still here
I'm lost in my silent screams

Everytime, when I close my eyes I feel the cold inside
For everything said and done I must pay the price
Hear me screaming in my bed I'm waiting for it's end
There's a voice in my head that doesn't let me rest...

"Every single time that you close your eyes you feel
I know everything that you said and done and all you did wrong
Just close your eyes
Just close your eyes"

Finally we meet again
I can see repent before my eyes
No need to tell me reasons why because I was at your side
I'll put fear in your head and let me freeze you spine
Let me now introduce myself I'm all your silent screams!!

Everytime, when I close my eyes I feel the cold inside
For everything said and done I must pay the price
Hear me screaming in my bed I'm waiting for it's end
There's a voice in my head that doesn't let me rest...


There's one bullet in his gun
And no matter what happened
It must follow it's deadly fate

I don't know who trust
I don't know who I am
I don't know if I got any friends at all

Time has come to decide
No matter what I do
Time to face it's destiny
Eternay tragedy

One thousand sentences running through my head
Million targets to aim
Maybe my own head

My existence seems so empty and foolish
There's no meaning in this life and now I understand

Time has come to decide
No matter what I do
Time to face it's destiny
Eternal tragedy

This bullet must now follow it's destiny
Can you release me from eternal tragedy
My hands are shaking my head is confused
There's no time left
Pull the goddam trigger now

Time has come to decide
No matter what I do
Time to face it's destiny
Eternal tragedy

This bullet must now follow it's destiny
Can you release me from eternal tragedy
My hands are shaking my head is confused
There's no time left
Pull the goddam trigger now

Time has come to decide
No matter what I do
I have always been lonely
Living this fake life
So full of emptness and lies
There's no painless wayout
Breakout from this hell!


Walking on the same streets every night
Moving in circles
I'm waiting for you
Living in mistakes inside his prison without walls

Throught the old time's toad
In the wrong way of destiny
I'm waking up...
Between the walls that I build myself

I'm the man you've never met
On Your Waiting on the other side of the door
This child you see in my eyes
Is just a mirror

Simple memories for me are too much
Like your smeel that exhales the untouch
I went beyond
And For the sin I'm bleeding

I close my eyes
I see two fallen angels burning in despair
You and I
So close and so far away
I'm arrest by desire
That mould me in ashes without renew
This is my sacrifice!
Too beyond that it should be

My tears confusing with the rain
You don't understand my feeling
Feel myself everywhere
Except inside of you

Ruddy sky reflected on innocent eyes
Emerald eyes
That I'll never forget
I'll never forget

But I'm lost inside four walls
Under me a nymph without a soul
The same emerald eyes
But there is not any gleam
The same wound behind our eyes
We are too much young to die
I've never imagine
That our ruins come from love

I close my eyes
I see two fallen angels burning in despair
You and I
So close and so far away
I'm arrest by desire
That mould me in ashes without renew
This is my sacrifice!
Too beyond that it should be

Save me from the chains of pain
Your shadows still traces my bed
I'm losing myself
And I can hear you say:
you're going away
can't return to the beggining
Don't you understand?

Close your eyes
I'm just a fallen angel burning in despair!
Live or die
In your absence is simple detail for me
Close your eyes!!
I'm just a fallen angel, now you can see me?
Sacrifice!
That someday you'll understand, but will be too late...

ANDRAGONIA LYRICS


The fanfare chants, trumpets loud proclaim
Through all the world in the holy land's name
Obtain mutual forgiveness of each vice,
And crush the opened gates of paradise.


Oh god, oh lord
Make the devil keep his word
Oh God of all
Now see the symbol fall

The mortal virtues in great fear
Formed the cross and nails and spear
Tainted dignity stands next in line
One soul alone, the disease of time


Oh god, oh lord
Make the devil keep his word
Oh God of all
Now see the symbol fall

Now burn the flag of discipline
To raise the fists of libertine
For all moral virtues all begin
Cleanse the people blessed with sin

...AND OCEANS LYRICS


The nights fall and skies fall
Down here we the sinners crawl
In dead cities and empty streets
All in ruins, but silence never sleeps


This world is fragile
Alone and silent
This world is fragile
And we are absent

Under melting skies - Into cold light


Savour!
The things that never were!
Escape!
To/from reality!
That never was!
That never will be!

Prohibit!
All the little things!
Crawl!
Into serenity!
That could've been!
That will never be!


Smile - I said smile you slime

Smile!
It's all falling apart!
Plunge!
Into catastrophe!
That was today!
That remains the same!



It's all falling apart




Another day another night
It's all the same, but is it forever
Another way another time
Silence and happiness now together
Another end another life
It's all the same; it's all over
Another smile for parasites
And the dogs that can smell her


Can't you see the light? Can't you see the light?
No, no, no, no
Can't you see the light? Can't you see the light?
No, no, no, no
Can't you see the light? Can't you see the light?
No, no, no, no
Can't you see the light? Can't you see the light?
No, no, no, no

Another face another smile
Nails carving deeper and deeper
Another eye another sight
Seeing nothing never and ever
Another form another light
Crawling higher, higher and higher
Another skin another white
And a sun that is brighter



Another voice another sigh
Calling stronger and stronger
Another scent another life
Now smell the filth odour
Another taste another try
On your tongue the fruit so bitter
Another world another side
In control to crush your soul



Another face another form
It is her face that forms worms


Listen: the fragile world is silent
Tongues speak a voice of decay
Of the melting skies and the heavy rains
About the odours of life so distant
We stand as silhouettes of today
Empty as the sky with our bodies vacant


Heavy is the silence of today
This world will fall - our world will fall
Into the silence of today
It will fall as the silent rain

Feel: the presence is a stolen moment
Lost are we in the lives of dismay
Between horizons and the limbo grey
Bloated we swim in the scent
Soon time eats the life away
But, I hope there's a little life in us left




It's a crime - it is a crime to be innocent
In life - in this life and presence
All life - all life is indifferent
Now's when - when all's past and gone


Turn away - fade away
Turn away - fade away

It's a crime - it is a crime to be silent
When colours - when colours have no nuance
You little - you little insects
Splashed out - splashed out of all essence

Fade away - fade away
Fade away - closer every day





Today is the day - the world is going away
Today is the day - we're all going away

When will we dream away; end this life in dismay
See the last sad rays, as flowers we wither away



When will time eat us away; our dead faces portray
Turn all of us cold and grey, the years will sweep us away




As flowers on the grave of earth inferno
We are all good people
Dressed not in white we are
Ascendants of heaven
In a symbolic imaginative essence
Descending angels we are
Falling as rain to impure the ground
And to flourish as flowers
Before we wither
With a scent of heavenly dew

As time that gnaws on the bones of life
We are the floating liquid flesh
The crawling sinners we are
Melting the heavens
As death silences all sweet voices
Renders of the clouds we are
Swarming as sinners to the universal presence of the fall
And to taste the fruits of lunacy
Before we fall
Into a devilish exercise


Time drips in passionate decay
Lost between eternities' scent
Sun burns brighter every day
Flaming fires like nails of torment


No place to crawl - no space to fall

A moment of clarity
Devoured by purity
Voices swallowed by hunger
As death shines brighter
All images drowned in eyes
Into light under melting skies




Purify!
Earth inferno!
Into the void!
Plunge into darkness cold!
Into darkness, light visible!
A divine remedy!
Cleansed of all impurities!

Evaporate!
Totally absolute!
Into the void!
The light of the night!
Black holes fill the souls!
World's beauty sleep!
New faces portrayed!

Dehydrate!
The beauty of lies!
End of life's odours!
Tripod oblivion!
Marionettes!
Hung from the ceiling!
Universal crucifixion!


New order!
Re-formation!
Consumption!
New world!
Completion!
Celebration!


The light of the sun - is so cold down here
My dirty desert tongue - licking like dogs forever
Open wounds never heal - for a slave in its flesh
The scent of joy we feel - A naked soul crushed


It's all empty - it's all white
It's all empty - empty as the sky

Silence & happiness in one - but way too many insects
You, yours and all of them - you are all like rats
Crawl into the light cold - celebrate your new skin
Dead and clean to the wound - An escapee of all sins




I love this world
And these people, the beautiful ones
I love this world
And your goddamn sun

I love this world
And the family of fragile dreams
I love this world
When the world goes to sleep


You're so pretty - planet dead
You're so pretty - planet dead
You're so pretty - planet dead
You're so pretty - planet dead

I love this world
Empty with its black holes
I love this world
And the ones without a soul

I love this world
With a bullet for each one
I love this world
When tomorrow never comes




There lies a body: cold, bloated and empty
Like all the other: victims together
The happiness in silence: good without pretence
And the last day: with a smile on the face

There lies a body: pretty soak in ebony
Like all the worms: in their corridors
Liquid flesh endowed: to impure the ground
And the fallen souls: make the flowers grow


We float, drift and pass away
For ever and a day

The debris of time falls into oblivion
As heavens open its gates of lies
Gone is the light of the sun
And nigh is the final harvest of life


Touch me!
I am a disease!
Clean me!
Imprisoned in flesh I am!
I am sin!

Smell me!
I am a slave!
Release me!
The impure flesh I am!
I am pleasure!

Taste me!
I am life!
Kill me!
Punishment I am!
I am beauty!

Feel me!
I am cold!
Cleanse me!
Purify me from all life!
I am free!

Electro eroticism
Intelligence is sexy
Electro eroticism
Intelligence is sexy

Electric God
Sonic Fraud
Organic Cloud
Erotic Flood

Electro eroticism
Intelligence is sexy
Electro eroticism
Intelligence is sexy

Stuck in a junction of transparent corridors
Multifarious structures and intricated patterns
Lost in a jungle between indexes
A paradian of systematic metroplex

Synchronize
Sensitize
Stigmatize

Electric God
Sonic Fraud
Organic Cloud
Erotic Flood

Electro eroticism
Intelligence is sexy
Electro eroticism
Intelligence is sexy


Inhale/exhale
Inhale the exhaled
Inhale/exhale
Inhale the injected voice
Inhale/exhale
Exhale the inhaled
Inhale/exhale
Inhale the lines of white noise

Silence depicted the room
And released the liquids in drops
Infinity licks the tongue of thorns
And devours the cities in drone

These designers of syndromes
The core of poison free sound
Slowly drifting to the mind of dub

Gardens swallow the idyllic life
Inhales heavens to earthly eyes
Open palms of autumn scars
Adieus to plaintive solar charm


Under the dark sky we stand
Under heavy rain we walk
Your hand in mine, my eyes in tears
Here where heaven is forgiven
Here where tears have no name


Wet as rain
I kiss your tears
Tears don't cry
They have no name

As the dark water pours down
We grow like wild summer roses
With no sun in sight
No footsteps left behind
All this love built on pain
Still the tears have no name



The last touch of your cold lips
That light, that warm desire
Through the holes of the night
We slide in the night
In oceans of heaven
The tears have no name

Our eyes filled with black tears of heaven
Flowers drowned in the darkening oceans
In solitude we all do the same
Coz our tears have no name

The angel of my dream
Carried away to the stars
Hurt by your cruelty
I breath your beauty
Alone in the rain
With tears that have no name


Seducer sun shine on me
Familiar scene, fever dream, hallucination
This beauty of paradise
Even pigs might fly
We're all mesmerised like flies 'round shit



Pigs, pigs, pigs
Esprit de corps
Pigs, pigs, pigs
You're the victims

Fertile sun, love of life
Philosophic suicide or cyanide
Illumination sunday sun sing tonight
Sing my cherub parasites
Gentle as lambs
Can be cursed by the light called sanity



Mirage's your guiding star
Last breath before the dark
When your heart's in the mouth
I lead you up the garden path




The black iris devours pictures in silence
The image of devils light my consonance
The I of consolation
The eye of consolidation

Graves are the garden trees
Dead all flowers and so are we
Silent moves of the summer flies
Engraved clouds below divided skies
Insect influx, the scent of the dogs
My sweet flower, and insect on the cross



Darkly wise odour of the evil tongues
Odious and devious
I despise
Jinx of eden
Black paradise

Lips of times of secret 
Murmur evil sprouts
Purges the redeemer
Purge

The angel of voices
Injected by silence
Last breath of nails
Needles and icons
The eye of consolidation
The I of consolation
Taste the lips of ancient pleasures
Eat the fruit of darkly treasures




Night swells to distant spheres
Silent throat of unholy times
The withering wind deep down here
Flesh of the gods bleeding as light

Here in the environs of heaven
The am sun am outshined one
The idea of beauty is ebony
The last am on my balcony

Forever people suffer in silence
Always and forever drifting to dark waters
The sand of time, still ominous
As scultured cherubs of the ether
The idea of beauty is ebony
The last am on my balcony

"The am sun, my ebony sun"

Erratic firmament and the perishing clouds
Descending angels, formless divine
To inherit light and silence, so profound
The devlish eyes of the reptile

Here in the environs of heaven
The am sun am outshined one
The idea of beauty is ebony
The last am on my balcony


Opulent kinetic sculptures
Visualized voices in motion
Plastic puppet pictures
Audial dances distortion

Dead stars, dead stars
Oh yes we are dead stars inwards

I am the pulse of achromatic idols
The fix of cyclic icons
In the land of nod
The orb of angels 
And the horns after gods 
Adored through a needle

Opulent kinetic sculptures
Visualized voices in motion
Plastic puppet pictures
Audial dances distortion

Dead stars, dead stars
Oh yes we are dead stars inwards

In the land of nod
The orb of angels 
And the horns after gods 
Adored through a needle
